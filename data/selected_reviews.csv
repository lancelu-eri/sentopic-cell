“Good Location!”,"We went there september 2010, stayed 10 days. This is a very good low budget hotel. If you visit New York you don't spend allot of time in your hotel, only for sleeping and showering. Quite basic but still good. Staff is very friendly, the hotel is clean. If you walk a bit upwards from the hotel,to the metrostation, you'll find an very nice mexican restaurant. Very good food!!",Sep-11,260396,5,134218931,4,Karen M
“perfect”,"This hotel was amazingly priced for the location and wonderful accomodations!
The room was a wonderful size for an NYC hotel. Bathroom was a great size and had a tub and not a standup shower.
Rooms were clean. Nicely decorated. Clean. Quiet. Pleasent staff.
Fabulous location!!!!",Oct-10,260396,10,104840029,5,sunnydayz225
"“Quiet, great location, and CHEAP”","Stayed here one Saturday night in December before Christmast. Close to the Met and Central Park! Very quiet room with no bath, but it was cheap.",Dec-10,260396,36,98778623,3,JCoffelt
"“Clean, comfortable and great location, loved it!!”","We spent 5 nights in Oct 2010 and we had a clean, fresh-smelling room. We faced the front, right over the bar entrance and slept with window open and heard no noise. The staff was great, helped us open windows on the top, gave directions for using the bus to La Guardia airport and were very friendly. The location was great--lots of restaurants, grocery close by and only 4 short blocks to subway. We were close to Central Park & felt safe walking around at night. We will definitely stay at the Amsterdam Inn when we return to New York.",Oct-10,260396,2,90059612,4,JoAnnTX
"“Dank, Smelly, Depressing and with heavy early am construction to Boot”","I stayed a few weeks ago, dropped my bags at the pleasant ( and very clean) reception area, and then headed out for the day. I returned early evening and found that the room they had given me was directly next to a bathroom. 
The room was dank, the carpet was soggy, the linens appeared to have been changed before my arrival, but they were stained and torn - nothing you want to see when you enter a hotel room.
Because of its proximity to the toilet, and the sewage smell coming from the bathroom, the room smelled and felt like an extension of the bathroom.
Add to the equation thin walls and drafty windows and ear splitting drilling and heavy construction that began early in the am, and you've basically got a nightmare on your hands.
After I saw the room, I immediately went back to reception to ask if they could switch my room. They said they were full. I asked if they could move me the next morning, but they said all the rooms had been assigned for the following night. (This contradicted what I was told when I arrived, that rooms were assigned to new guests by midday.) All that they offered me was air freshener that didn't even begin to help.
I have to say that the reception people were really nice, and it did look like the second floor of the hotel - where reception was - had been freshly cleaned and painted ( I did not see rooms, just the hallway). Also the location was great.
This place definitely has potential, for a basic hotel, it could be easily refreshed by simple and easy to vacuum rugs and an Ikea run, but alas..
I left as soon as construction woke me, and later called the manager who credited me about half back.
Even so, its beyond wrong to not warn travelers of construction, that will affect their stay, to say the least.
Having to find a hotel at 8pm for a last minute stay in new york is a nightmare too, something i wouldn't wish on anyone.
I did end up walking over to Hotel 17, which was the other place i was considering for my stay. I WISH i had chosen that place, set up was very similar, small rooms and shared baths down the hall, but the room they showed me was what the Amsterdam Hotel could be: clean, stylish, no frills but comfortable and a definite find for an ""affordable"" hotel in manhattan.",Oct-10,260396,4,85578805,1,simone65l
“I'll keep coming back.”,"I've stayed in the Amsterdam Inn twice in the last 5 years, and I will continue to do so until my legs can't carry me up the steps anymore. Yes, this property is a walk-up. But for the price, you will not get a better value in a good neighborhood in NYC. The rooms are clean and safe, and the staff is exceptional. I'm guessing they ask you to leave the key at the front desk because they still actually use KEYS not key cards, and they can be expensive and time consuming to replace if they are lost by guests. 
I don't understand the reviews saying mattress pads were not on mattresses and sheets were thread-bare. We had mattress pads and clean, soft, high quality sheets on both occasions my husband and I have stayed. 
The biggest reason I would recommend this hotel is the professionalism, courtesy, and integrity of the staff. My husband dropped his wallet in the room right before we checked out. TJ, the front desk attendant, called us within an hour after our leaving to let us know that the housekeeping staff had found it. With her help, we received my husband's wallet back the next day. We can't thank TJ, the housekeeping staff person, or the Amsterdam Inn enough.
So if you can stand the walk-up, a good neighborhood, clean rooms, courteous staff, and a great value, I'd highly recommend the Amsterdam Inn for your stay in NY. Central Park is only a couple blocks away, and there are tons of great restaurants and shopping in the area. It's everything we ever need for our stays there.",Oct-10,260396,4,83929422,4,boogieshoes10
"“So bad, we checked out after one night!”","We booked this hotel online and arrived into Nyc on thanksgiving night. After having to carry our luggage up stairs, we checked in and were given the room right next to reception.
The room was clean, but it was not worth the 200$ per night rate. 
Due to traveling 30+ hours we were extremely jet lagged and probably got an hours worth of sleep. The room was also extremely noisy, we could hear conversations that people were having at the bar downstairs. We decided to go for a walk and around 2am and reception said we had to hand the keys in which was really weird. After having a bit of breakfast in a 24 hr diner across the road, we made our way to macys for the black Friday 
sales. 
We had made the decision to check out of the hotel in the morning.
I would give this hotel a wide birth especially if you are stay for a long period of time ( we were in Nyc for 11 days.)
The website is misleading as it states it's a boutique hotel and the pictures don't even compare to the real room.
It is probably great for backpackers, but honestly don't know if a back packer would pay 200$ per night!",Dec-09,260396,10,83558596,1,Frequent_flyer1989
“NIce value”,"The hotel is definetely a nice option if you're on a small budget and don't want to stay in an unsafe neigborhood.
I had real little expectations about the hotel, as other reviews were pretty scaring, but I decided give the hotel a chance, as it was the only non-shared bathroom hotel room in Manhattam for less than U$ 200 per night (my rate was U$ 143 per night, before taxes).
The neighborhood is nice two blocks away from the subway and 4 blocks away from the AMNH. The dakota building is even closer. Nice places to eat near the hotel and a market to buy food to use in the microwave or store in the room fridge.
The reception area is really small and the steep stairs to reach it are kinda scary when you first met. Be prepared to carry your luggage as there won't be anyone to help you. But they'll keep your luggage if you arrive too early to check in or if you're going to leave late. So, it's not big deal it being so small. Maybe the only problem is if you stay in one of the rooms just next door to the reception, it can be a little noisy as the other guests necessarily will have to call in reception for their keys. My room was on the same floor as the reception and I really had no problem.
The room itself seems brand new (despite the 80's decoration) and had a nice queen size bed, cable TV (21 inches tube), microwave, fridge, a place to rest your luggage and a chair. The bathroom is great, not big but not the smallest I've ever seen, with a really nice shower with all hot water I needed. Complimentary bath amenities were unexpected as it's a 1 star hotel.
My only complaint as that the room and the bathroom were really clean when I arrived, but was not well cleaned every day - or not cleaned at all. The rubbish was collected everyday as the towels and bed linen was changed, but there was no real cleaning during my stay. As I've stayed for only 5 nights it was not a problem, but in a longer stay I would be worried.",Sep-10,260396,51,83344558,3,EricArthurBlair
“Misleading Website; Ok for resting your head”,"The staff at the Amsterdam Inn were really helpful and I felt very safe in the building. It was odd that they made you leave your room key at the desk every time you left the building, but maybe they have their reasons. The rooms are super old and not at all luxurious, but for people who just want to see New York as cheaply as possible (without full-on hostel environment) this is a great place for them. We just made sure we were locking up our suitcases every time we left the building. It was a great hotel for us because we literally left at 8am every day and returned 11pm or later, just to sleep. The beds were clean and the rooms, while very very old, were sufficient. There were shared bathrooms and it seemed like the staff spaced people out so there were a few people on each floor, meaning the bathrooms weren't crowded and the floors weren't noisy. I was comfortable there after the initial shock of the room passed.
If you look at the Amsterdam Inn's website you will notice they boast ""Newly renovated rooms with kitchenettes""...this was certainly not the case when we stayed there. Maybe SOME rooms have kitchenettes, but we sure didn't. It was unfortunate because we had hoped to have breakfast food at the hotel every day to minimize eating out. This hotel does not provide facecloths. You get towels, you get soap, but no facecloths. There was a sink in the bedroom which was actually really nice.
The outlet in the room (there was only one) was extremely loose so charging our phones or plugging in a curling iron was almost pointless, as they would keep flicking on and off. If you want a hairdryer here you have to LEAVE your identification at the front desk while you have the appliance. Not joking. I asked if they could just photocopy it, they said no.
The person I traveled with actually found a cockroach in their bed one night. I understand that bugs sometimes just find their way in there, but it was gross. Another night someone used the shared shower on our floor and left his underwear and towels in the washroom for HOURS. You had to climb over them to get to the toilet. When I asked the person at the front desk to have someone come up to take care of it, he said nobody works in the evenings. So basically we had to wait for that person to re-visit the bathroom and realize they left their things.
This hotel starts on the second floor of a building, and they have multiple floors, and NO elevator or escalator. So you could have to lug your things up to the 4th floor. They say wireless internet is available, so I called the front desk to order this internet service, and the guy at the desk told me I had to call a company called Natural Wireless to have it set up. It seemed ridiculous.
On our floor there were 2 showers...one in the main bathroom and one in a single shower room. The door to the shower room didn't lock.",Jun-10,260396,1,83063235,3,travelgirl709
“Very good for students”,"We enjoyed my stay in the Amsterdam Inn with my housband. We're students travelling with a budget and I think we got value for our money. The room was clean and kept clean the whole time. The size of the room was fine because we only needed it for sleep and rest. which we got (no disturbing noises). 
There were quite a lot of stairs for someone with bad knees or something but we didn't mind them even with our luggage.",Aug-10,260396,0,77833408,4,Karkkis
“A Nice Little Hotel at Reasonable Cost”,"My partner and I spent two nights at the Amsterdam Inn during a trip to the states in July. Most hotels in New York - at least those we checked on on the internet - are way overpriced. Only to be expected in a major city. We booked a ensuite queen room and were more than happy with the size and cleanliness of the room. Yes, it is basic however if you want five star luxury it comes at a greater cost! Given that we spent both days until late exploring the city the Inn suited our purposes just fine. 
The hotel is handy for Central Park and easy walking distance from a couple of subway stations. Also, no problem catching a cab - it is New York after all!
I've noted that a couple of other reviewers have mentioned that traffic noise and passersby disturbed them - what can I say? Yes, there is a bit of noise, but personally we just accepted that we were in the 'city that never sleeps', not the country, and put up with it. That said, our room was to the side and overlooked a building site where they started work pretty early although to be fair this isn't going to be a permanent state of affairs.
All in all, we enjoyed our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful. True, there is no lift however we were offered help to carry our luggage upstairs if required. I can honestly say we didn't have any real complaints and would stay here again.",Jul-09,260396,12,36874730,4,Champersgirl
“Don't stay at this place!”,"Together with a collegue I spend two nights in this hotel.
To be honest: it was not comfortable. We had a room at the front side of
the hotel just above the pub that is situated at the ground floor. The
amount of noise was terrible. Shouting people, loud music and a lot of
traffic. Things were really worsened by the fact that the window in
which the air-co apparatus was placed, was not properly sealed.
Moreover, we were not allowed to changs rooms... Please take account of
this before making a reservation!",Jun-09,260396,1,32197560,1,Karel27
“I would stay here again”,"I stayed alone at Amsterdam Inn a whole week last April and could confirm the good reviews I had read here. My room was a single with full bathroom (toilet + shower). Although modest, as I already expected, it was comfortable enough for one person and this was a good surprise. The room was cleaned every day and the towells were changed also on a daily basis. It had a TV set with not many channels (ESPN, USA, TNT and Weather Channel were some of them), but enough to entertain and keep informed a tired guest at the end of a day in New York. 
I found Amsterdam Inn a very clean and quiet hotel. The corridors floors were usually shining and only once in while I would hear the voices or steps of another guests -- and the hotel was not empty. Just out of curiosity, I checked the toilets and showers outside the rooms and found them also clean. Some reviews here mentioned the stairs. In fact, climbing the stairs may be a little hard, especially if you are carrying heavy luggage. When you arrive at the address of Amsterdam Inn, you have to ring a bell. The recepcionist opens the front door remotely and then you have to climb a fairly steep flight of stairs. You get to the front desk and, depending on the number of your room, maybe you'll have to climb one or two more flights of stairs. The latter was my case: I stayed in the fourth floor. Was that a problem? Not at all. My luggage was realy heavy only when I checked out, as I had bought lots of books. By then, I had a little trouble to carry the suitcase, but it was something far from unattainable.
I have only compliments to the staff. They were attentive and helped me when I had to solve a problem back in my hometown, in Brazil. They were very patient too trying to understand me when I spoke my broken English. 
The hotel provides the guest every day a voucher, which entitles its holder to have a cup of coffee (or juice) and a bagel with white cheese or butter (or jelly? I forgot what the second option was) in a coffe shop one block away. I found this great, since I´m not used to really have a breakfast. Usually, I have only a cup of coffee in the morning. So, it was a great deal for me to have for free a cup of coffee and a bagel, which was very tasty, by the way. Those vouchers saved me some precious dollars.
The Amsterdam Inn location is great. It´s a few blocks away from some city atractions, like Central Park, American Museum of Natural History, Lincoln Center, Riverside Park etc. There are at least two subway stations nearby. It´s also a great neighborhood, with good and cheap places to eat, like Artie's, at Broadway (where you can also find Zarbar´s), good bookshops and beautiful residencial buildings. For those people who really like to walk, like myself, the hotel is at a walking distance from some other interesting places, like Columbus Circle (where you find a Whole Foods store), Apple Store and so on. I found the neighborhood quite safe. Many times I returned to the hotel late at night and saw nothing suspicious. 
Finally, I paid an average rate of US$ 109 per night. It was my first time in New York. I loved the city and I am highly satisfied with Amsterdam Inn. 
PS.: Two more informations that may be useful for another travellers.
From JFK Airport to Amsterdam Inn, I got a van from SuperShuttle. The trip costed US$ 21 (US$ 19 + US$ 2 driver´s tip). It took a little longer than a cab would, I guess (one hour and 15 minutes, it was raining and the traffic was heavy), but I have no complaints. I was the second passenger to be dropped off at the hotel. When I left New York, I flew to Orlando early in the morning. To avoid any problems, I hired a private car with driver from a transportation service recommended by the Amsterdam Inn front desk. I paid US$ 40 from the hotel to La Guardia Airport. The trip took about 30 minutes.",Apr-09,260396,2,30479561,4,osvaldoRiodeJaneiro
"“Great Place, The Amsterdam Inn”","I stayed at the Amsterdam Inn during the easter day weekend. I booked a clean bed with a private bathroom. I got it at a great price of $109.00 plus tax. I was very pleased with the cleansliness of the hotel. My room was serviced daily. The staff was very helpful and pleasent. The stairs could be a stretch but it's typical for N.Y.C. The location is amazing, you can't beat it, you're two blocks away from central park and one block away from Broadway. The area is very active day and night , which made me feel more comfortable coming and going. I would recommend the Amsterdam Inn to anyone who want's to pay a cheap price for a good value.",Apr-09,260396,0,28330612,5,nishacutie24
“Be Careful”,"I stayed at this hotel on my return visit to NY. In hindsight I should have stayed with the hotel I used outbound. 
Firstly there are no safes in the rooms and the staff are lightfingered. I had $1,000 worth of camera equipment taken from a closed suitcase. They request you leave your key with reception when you go out, somthing the NYPD told me not to do. When I approached reception about the missing items, the single person on reception didn't even respond, simply picked up the phone and spoke in another language. When he put the phone down he told me there was nothing he could do and that I should leave a statement. I told him I was contacting the police, he then shrugged his shoulders and told me there was nothing they could do. The manager had left, and when I asked the receptionist to raise her on the phone, she told me the housekeeping staff had left for the day and there was nothing she could do. I then called the police who took a statement and recommended I find a better hotel to stay in. What made me angry was that the staff seemed disinterested. Given that the person needed time to go through my suitcase, and my room was two doors from reception, it was obviously (as the police confirmed) an inside job. 
I had previously stayed at the Buckingham hotel and would suggest that as a better alternative.",Apr-09,260396,0,27389416,1,Lisal61
“Good value”,"I stayed in a queen room with bathroom. No complaints. Staff consistently friendly and helpful. Initial impression very poor: the entrance is swathed in scaffolding. One is buzzed into a dingy, smelly vestibule with a narrow, wooden staircase going up one storey. I thought ""Oh no!"" But, upon ascending the stairs I was pleasantly surprised. A building across the road is being torn down but I did not find the noise level a problem. About ten blocks to Lincoln Centre and four blocks to Zabar's. The Inn should drop their price a bit and skip the ""free breakfast"" which consists in coffee or juice and a bagel, served in a decidedly downmarket shop about a block away. Unfortunately, they don't have safety deposit boxes or valuables check. One has to buy in to a wireless initernet service.",Feb-09,260396,11,25728894,3,RonTSmithers_B_C_
“Cheap and Cheerful”,"My husband and I booked into the Amsterdam Inn as he was taking part in the New York Marathon. This hotel was choosen for its location to the finish of the marathon. We found the hotel in a very pleasant quiet residual area, very close to all the sights. We both enjoyed our stay at this hotel - the room cleaned daily and fresh towels whenever needed. At the end of the day you dont go to New York to spent all day in a hotel room and the price is important and the voucher for breakfast an added bonus. A lift would have been welcome.",Oct-08,260396,3,21622011,4,MarykateBelfast
"“Great choice in NYC, the Amsterdam Inn”","My boyfriend and I booked a week at the Amsterdam Inn early September this year. After reviewing other hotels in NYC that one seemed like a good choice for the value. We booked a double bedroom with bathroom share.
At arrival, the guy at the reception was very nice. The room was not big but just the good size and very clean. You have TV, two big mirrors and a sink. The toilets/ bathroom on the same floor were also very clean. They remained clean for the rest of the week, which shows that the cleaners were doing a great job all day long.And you never have to wait to go to the loo or the shower room.Our bed was done everyday and the towels changed daily as well. The hotel informed us before booking that some building work was currently taking place and it would start at 7am.
To be honest, yes there was noise, but that didnt stop us from sleeping properly, even until 10am one morning.
The hotel location is ideal. The upper west side is very calm and a nice neighbourhood. Three subway stops are available around the hotel within 10 min walk. The area offers a great choice of restaurants and diners for the breakfast. And the icing on the cake, there is a pub below the hotel where you can go back in the evening to have a nice diner for a reasonable price rather than wondering where to eat in this huge town.
At the reception, the guys were always smiling and ready to help.
So really, i would defenitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to spend some time discovering NYC, and doesnt want to spend hundreds in a hotel where you will only a few hours per day, but dont want to end up in a nasty B&B either!
Go on their website to have a look, they also have two other hotels situated downtown!",Sep-08,260396,30,20393958,4,nefertitiLondon
“Loved the more-than-adequate Amsterdam Inn”,"Fellow reviewers, you misled me. From the previous reviews, we were wondering if we'd made a mistake by booking with no research, but the price was great ($109/night on a weekend, booked the day of), and I have fond memories of hostel-hopping at many like places in Europe. From the complaints ranging from dirty rooms to rude staff, my expectations were low. We were so pleasantly surprised that I feel like I should give five stars! The staff was delightful and helpful, the room was completely clean, the bathroom was newly renovated with tile everywhere, there was a clean and sparkly sink in our room (which was 310, a full with shared bath), the sheets were clean and smelled good, and lo and behold, we had air conditioning, contrary to several reviews. We even had a TV! If you're the type who would rather spend money on a great restaurant than on a hotel room where you'll spend 8 hours, tops, then this is a good option. Be flexible about the stairs and imagine that you have an ideally located studio apartment in the greatest city in the country. If the Hyatt is more your speed and you tend to find lots to complain about, try another hotel. 
Not all rooms have the free breakfast voucher, so ask upon booking. The deposit is a refundable $10.",Aug-08,260396,1,19560190,4,kgw1538
“Pay the extra money & go somewhere else!!!!”,"My partner and I stayed at the Amsterdam Inn for 3 nights in May 2008. We paid $130 per night (including tax) for a Double Room with Shared facilties. This was the cheapest accommodation in New York we could find. As soon as we got there we wished we had payed the extra $20 and gone somewhere else. The only good thing about this place is the location. It is centrally located, near transport & only a couple blocks away from Central Park. The room was tiny & not overly clean. The room had a tiny bed, a tiny rack to hang your clothes on, a small basin & a chest of drawers. It was stuffy but we couldn't open the tiny window because right next to our room was a massive construction site that continued to be noisy every morning from 6am to 7pm. There were 2 toilets & 2 showers on our floor, one of which was so small you couldn't even sit down properly because the door would hit your knees. It was also not the cleanest. Breakfast was not included & there was no Internet. The stairs were steep & the staff at reception are rude. They were too busy talking on the phone to serve. If you want to store your bags, there is no safely locked room, you just have to put it behind the front desk with the staff. We would not stay here again, nor would we recommend this place to anyone. You will be better off paying an extra $20 a night & going somewhere else.",May-08,260396,21,19321047,1,ClareandMichaelPerth
“OK if your on a tight budget”,"We stayed at the Amsterdam Inn for one night, we chose it because it was the cheapest we could find for that night and all the other hotels were very expensive. The main problem with this hotel is that there is no lift, we had to carry our two large cases up three flights of very steep stairs, but we did get some help from a member of staff. 
The hotel room was generally clean as was the shared bathroom. The room was very very small and it was a struggle to open our suitcase because of the lack of space. Overall the hotel was fine for us as we only stayed for one night and were looking for some where cheap.",Jun-08,260396,0,19022770,3,jenc_6
“Don't stay here unless you really can't find somewhere else”,"Admittedly this hotel is on the cheap side for New York, but I wish we had forked out a bit more. It adjoins a large building site and the noise was inescapeable, add the clanking of the ancient (but very necessary) air conditioning and it was impossible to sleep. Breakfast was supposedly included, but it amounted to a voucher for a dirty bagel bar just up the road, that gave you a bagel and a drink with nowhere decent to sit and eat it.",Jul-08,260396,0,18777972,1,USAtraveller_8
“The Amsterdam Inn gets our vote!”,"We spent 4 nights at the Amsterdam Inn in July. This was our first trip to NYC, and not wanting to pay the price of most hotels, I relied on Tripadvisor and other travel sites to research other options. I was looking for basic, clean, with private bathroom facilites.
The Amsterdam Inn met these and more. I must point out, we were on the first floor, in a ""deluxe queen"", so I can't speak for the upper floors (no elevator, and some shared bathrooms). We were very satisfied, and paid from $100 to $200 less per day than the average New York hotel rate. Restaurants are numerous, many are inexpensive, the subway staion is 3 blocks away, the buses run on Amsterdam Ave., it is 2 blocks to Central Park. The staff was friendly and helpful. Negatives: the one window looked out onto the construction of a new building and eventually will look at the wall, and also the bed sheets were thin.
We travel quite a bit, and normally stay in chain hotels like Quality Inn, Holiday Inn Express, etc. This was very comparable, and I recommend the Amsterdam to anyone not demanding luxury.",Jul-08,260396,3,18386839,3,the_sd_dane
“Only for those on a VERY tight budget!”,"Stayed at the Amsterdam for 3 nights. Although it was not a disaster, I would not stay here again. It is for those on a very limited budget only. It has no charm or warmth. Because of the construction the corner is dusty and noisy. The actual construction noise was not that bad in the morning, although our room did not face the site. There are a lot of stairs and carrying your luggage can be a problem. (Although they did ask if we needed help when we checked in.) The check in desk is located one flight up from the street. The staff, although not nasty, are not very welcoming or friendly. The room was very tiny. There is the bed, sink, and dresser. Even an extra chair would have been nice, although I guess it wouldn't fit. The bed barely accomodated my husband and me and we are not very large people. It was not easy to sleep as the bed was pushed up against the wall. If you are tall or need extra room, forget it. The carpet was worn and didn't seem too clean. Be sure to bring flip-flops! To me, a smell permeated the room like air freshener covering up old smoke. The shower/bathroom was down the hall and smelled of bleach so I guess it was clean. We have stayed at The Bellclaire which is in the same neighborhood and also has shared bath rooms. I would definitely pay the extra to stay there or try another hotel next time.",Jul-08,260396,22,18143311,2,kmjohnson
“A nothing special hotel”,"Stayed in The Amsterdam Inn for a week. Eventually we got used to the noise of the contractors next door who have been building a condo for the last year.
The accommodation is very basic but with good TV stations and decent showering facilities.
The staff were friendly but woke us up several times wanting to clean the room.
I think I would wait until the work had been finished before I stayed again",May-08,260396,1,16511765,2,AnnieTring
“Pay the extra and go somewhere else.”,"This hotel sounded great - a boutique hotel, European feel - well forget it! I did not feel safe here, it felt like a half-way house. I skeeved everything! If you know what skeeved means you won't want to stay here. To top it off my credit card info was stolen and this is the only place I used that credit card. Not worth it.",Feb-07,260396,5,16444815,1,mammymoo
“Mixed feelings about this place...”,"It is with mixed feeling that I have to give this place a negative review overall.
My son and I travelled to the USA in April of 2008 (holiday of a lifetime so far for me) starting in LA then to SF across to Boston then down to Martha's Vineyard and finishing in NYC at the Amsterdam before heading back home to Australia. This hotel was the worst we stayed at during our 3 weeks. But I need to qualify a few things.
NEGATIVES:
There is massive construction still taking place next door and it will continue for some time. Construction work starts exactly at 7.00am however, the workers turn up much earlier and start making a LOT of noise. The Amsterdam is literally about 3 feet away from the construction. It is very, very noisy during the week because of this. Trust me on this!!! But, to be fair, there is construction taking place all over NYC.
Rooms are very small and the sheets and blankets are thin. No elevator, tables, chairs, air-conditioning or coffee making facilities.
No elevators at all so you must haul your luggage up at least one fight of steep stairs
POSSITIVES:
Location. Everything and I mean everything is just a few blocks away. Subway, diner, grocery store, laundromat, tons of other places to eat, Central Park, bar, museum, Broadway, drug-store and on and on and on.
Bathroom was very clean and the cleaning staff were efficient and approachable.
I found all the staff friendly and helpful. If you have had negative experiences, then maybe it was your approach.
CONCLUSION: I would not stay here again UNTIL the construction work is finished. This is a very noisy place currently. Then again, you do not travel to NYC for peace and quiet. If you are not spending much time in your room (and who wants to?) then this place is okay. All the above aside we had a fantastic time in NYC and I would do it again tomorrow if I could.",Mar-08,260396,9,15737865,3,Mebollocks
“Not Bad for the Price”,"Stayed there one night, in the cheapest room in the place. The hotel is exceedingly clean for what you'd expect from a budget hotel. Being in the cheapest room, I had had to share bathrooms, which were plentiful and also very clean. The TV worked fine, with about 20 cable channels. Now, there is one drawback, and is one that will abate eventually: There is a construction project adjacent to the hotel, and the workers start moving about at 6:30 a.m. They don't start the banging of hammers until 7 a.m., so until the building project is completed, this will be a problem for late sleepers.",Apr-08,260396,1,14738913,3,deanyc
"“Nightmare, but ADVENTURE”","My friend and I didn't know what to expect when we went to the Amsterdam Inn. If it's your first time in New York, you won't care about the hotel because you'll be so excited and so busy. But when we got there, we had to hike up the dangerously steep steps, get our key and hike another 4 floors. Once we got up there we noticed there were public washrooms and bathrooms. We paniced but once we got into our TINY room, we realized we had a bathroom of our own. We had one bed, with cigarette holes etc... in the sheets. We thought we were getting two double beds but we only got the one with a huge dip in the middle. The room was super small. No extra pillows, just the one that they gave us, so when we asked the front desk they gave us an extra blanket. But honestly it was an adventure and an experience. It wasn't unbearable, just humorus. The location is pretty awesome though. You can get to central park, just down the road or hop on broadway and walk anywhere!!!",Mar-07,260396,1,14502311,2,canadian_birss
“Decent accomodation for the price”,"The Amsterdam Inn is a great bargain for people looking to stay on the Upper West Side. The rooms are tiny, but comfortable. This is a great place for people who come to NYC to experience the city and only need a place to sleep after a long day of being out and about. The hotel looks a little sketchy from the outside, but the inside is pretty clean and well lit. My only complaint is that we could only get scalding water out of our shower. We were only there for 1 night so it was no big deal, but it was a little annoying.",Feb-08,260396,15,13361649,3,aggupta
“Clean and Quirky”,"The Amsterdam Inn has all the character of its upper-West-Side neighborhood and the location, near the Natural History museum, is ideal for exploring Central Park. Subway access is within two blocks, making all of Manhattan easily accessible. The rooms are reasonably sized for a budget hotel and everything was very clean. 
But there are a few shortcomings: 1. There is no control over the heat and when it comes on you'll be throwing the windows open, even in the middle of February. This brings us to . . . 2. The street outside and the bar downstairs can be very noisy 'til late at night 3. There is no air conditioning in the rooms. 4. There is no elevator and the stairs are very narrow. 5. Staff professionalism is inconsistent - some of the folks at the Amsterdam Inn are very helpful and friendly, others seem rather moody and aloof, or don't follow up when they say they will. 
Still, if you're on a tight budget, it's not easy to find a better bargain in New York City than the Amsterdam.",Feb-07,260396,7,13341628,2,Phaed0
“Beware: Building Site Next Door”,"This hotel was such a disappointment. 
The Amsterdam Inn is part of a boutique(?) group called NYInns which have 3 small hotels throughout Manhattan, one in Murray Hill, one in Union Square and this one on Amsterdam Avenue. 
I had been to NYC in February 06 and stayed at the Murray Hill Inn, which at that time, I found to be a great low budget option. So naturally, when I returned to NYC in November 07, I decided to stay in Murray Hill Inn again which also proved to be a big dissappointment (see my Murray Hill Inn review). I briefly left NYC and returned to stay at the Amsterdam Inn as the Murray Hill was booked out (all bookings in November for both hotels were done in advance being too late notice to change hotels without incurring huge cost).
To my horror - the hotel is currently balancing precariously on the edge of a massive construction site next door. I suggested to the receptionist that there should be a warning on the website about the fact that there is a construction site next door, to which he responded, ""there is!"". I said, ""there isn't, otherwise I wouldn't have booked!"". As of today (31st December 2007) there still isn't! There is however, an A4 sheet paper sign at reception advising guests of the construction site. Gee whiz, how considerate.
As the property was constantly overheated (about 85F (30C)) due to the archaic Manhattan steam heating system, we needed to crack a window open in order to bring the temperature down to a more livable level - rather than the desert-like conditions we were experiencing in the room. Lucky for us (sarcasm), we were on the side of the building next to the building site. So there was no need for an alarm clock and bang on 7am the construction workers started hammering away. I had anticipated this, and requested a change of room the night before to which I was told they were booked out and there was nothing available. To add insult to injury, the sheets were so worn that they were practically transparent, the bed squeeked when ever you made the slightest movement (same problem at Murray Hill Inn) and the showers barely broke the luke warm barrier. All in all, one of the worst hotel experiences to date.
I understand it is not the hotel's problem that there is a construction site next door, however I do expect that they have a responsibility to inform their potential guests when they are making a booking. I suspect their reason for not doing this is the loss of business, however they could offer cheaper rates to encourage people to stay. 
Anyway, on complaining to the hotel in writing they offered me a reduction from the $173 I paid for the privlidge to stay in the hotel to $99. What a joke. I won't ever stay in this hotel again, nor any of the other NYC Inns. They really need to take a look at themselves. Despite the fact they position themselves as budget botique hotel - this should mean compromising basic amenities such as hot water, sheets in good condition, a quiet bed and some degree of climate control.
I would strongly suggest people consider staying elsewhere - at the very least for the time being.

“A New York City Bargain”,"This is not a hotel for everyone. However, if you have a sense of adventure and are looking for basic accommodations, the Amsterdam Inn may be for you. My wife and I stayed here for the 2007 New York City Marathon (November 1-4). We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel’s location at 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue is very central for midtown activities and also only two blocks from where the Marathon ends. We found the Amsterdam Inn to be secure, with a buzzer at the entrance and also at the second floor landing. An attendant is at the reception desk 24/7. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. Breakfast is included (at a coffee shop a block away). High speed internet is available (at extra cost). There is no elevator and yes, the stairs are steep. For New York City, the room rate cannot be beat ($159 weekdays, $179 weekend days). We enjoyed our stay and will return.",Nov-07,260396,30,10632430,4,DoctorPaul
“Good for the price”,"The Amsterdam was a pleasant surprise. It is very clean. The staff very helpful and will assist with luggage. I had a full bed with shared bath and the room was average sized.The bathroom was large and clean; in addition there was a separate small shower and toilet on the same floor. The only incident I had was with other occupants not cleaning up after themselves. When you share communal space it is common courtesy to try and clean up or at least tell the staff what needs cleaning. Otherwise the location is perfect, i rode the bus all the way down to Macy's in 25minutes. Just ask the staff how to get where you want to go.",Oct-07,260396,5,10358856,3,seasurf
"“Excellent hotel, great price”","My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a wedding over in Long Island, and I was very impressed. First impression is that our room was extremely small, but this was expected. Surprisingly, the room and bathroom were both spotless and looked like they had recently been remodeled. I was actually really impressed with the bathroom and the shower, it was nicer and ""fancier"" than any chain hotel I've stayed in. The price we paid (a little under $200) was excellent for the area. The room was quiet with little city noise coming it, but I'm sure this depends on where your window is. The hotel itself is really quaint and you get the New York City living experience due to its size (small) and location.
The staff at the hotel was great as well, and the two employees we interacted with were helpful when needed but otherwise stayed out of the way. I definitely recommend the Amsterdam if you're just one or two people and don't mind a very small room.",May-07,260396,3,10350209,4,rowuncw

We were lucky to get a lobby floor room because we only had one flight of stairs to climb. Our room was cozy and very clean and not too small. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The hotel is close to everything and in a pretty safe part of town, we always felt comfortable walking around - and for two country folks from New Zealand, that's saying something.

Subway a few minutes away, besides Central Park, very nice streets with lots of little café and restaurants. No there is no elevators, it is very small and not really made to help you relax, and it's not a hotel to stay for many nights or if you plan on staying in your room a lot... I recommend it for young travelers, couples, not sure for older people or families... but if you need a place to sleep and be in the center of NY and all the action, this is a very good place for the price. NOTE : if you get a special rate from a website, make sure to bring your sheet with the rate, as I had lost it and they charged me more than I was guaranteed!",Aug-07,260396,2,8457314,3,EmmyL

“The Worst Room Ever!!!!”,"Since our stay in April 2007 (one week!!) I tried to forget about this place!! Now let's honestly see all of it: our credit-card debit said 570 EUROS for 7 nights in a double room - i.e. 80 EUROS per night. So that's suuuper-budget for a hotel in N.Y.
B U T ......their web-site showed all those photos (which I also see here in the tripadvisors-photos...kind of room no. 401!!)
So I thought that the difference in price would be for the sharing/not sharing of the bathroom, while having the same room-standard, and so I opted for shared bathroom/no breakfast voucher.
MAN! After 15 hours of travelling, me (38 years - not 3 years!!) and my husband finally arrived and I had a 30 minutes of desperate crying!!! I carefully chose that place and it surely had nothing to do with the photos I saw!!!!
YES - that was David Lynch (beware of room 309). 
Shabby, horrible, dirty, filthy, MINI,depressing.
Moreover I am sure it was a single room, as one of us had to sit on the bed while the other was moving in the room!!!!)
That night we went out to stroll on the streets - though really tired - but I could not imagine to go back to that room (and kept on thinking of the endless 7 nights I had to stay there).
We immediately asked for a better room by paying the difference - but there was none free.
We paid 100 USD per night while the better ones seemed to be 140 USD (which I know now). The German couple next to us also had to share the bathroom BUT their room was at least the double of ours with nice furniture....it seemed as they were staying in another hotel .....!!
Being a budget-traveller most of the times - I really know what to expect (I travelled super-budget in London hostels and was really O.K. with it!!) but this time I really felt ""kicked in the ass"". 
WELL - New York made up for it - we hardly ever spent time in our room and we liked the zone because it seemed ""real"" N.Y.",Apr-07,260396,13,8031545,1,mela69

"“Budget price, budget hotel”","New York is an expensive city for hotels and I chose to stay at the Amsterdam Inn to try to same some cash. You can't expect much in NY for $139 a night, and the hotel lived up to that reputation.
First of all, if you have lots of luggage or trouble climbing stairs, I would stay away from the Amsterdam Inn. 4 floors of stairs only. I was on the top floor in a 'Double bed room' with a private bath. Many of the rooms here have shared shower facilities.
The room itself was clean, but very basic. Old beds, terribly uncomfortable pillows. Surprisingly, the bathroom looked like it had been somewhat renovated. Bathroom facilities were fine.
There is quite a lot of noise from outside traffic and the windows are not double glazed, so it can be a challenge to sleep. Also, there is a lot of construction going on in the lot directly next to the hotel, so that adds to the noise.
Staff were friendly and the included breakfast at the cafe up the road was basic but ok.
Overall, if you're looking for a place to sleep with only the basics, the Amsterdam Inn is ok, but don't expect too much or else you will be disappointed.",May-07,260396,51,7585753,2,2traveltheworld
“Just what we needed”,"After reading some reviews we weren't sure what we would find but the Amsterdam Inn was just what we required it was nice, clean, friendly and cheap . I also felt safe as you had to be buzzed up to the hotel and then again to the second floor. The accomodation was very basic but then we didn't actually spend much time in the hotel - apart from sleeping, there was just so much to do. The location is good - maybe a little far out for some of the places we wanted to go but if I was on a budget I would stay here again. Central Park is close and a nice walk through the Park soon gets you to the start of the shopping on 5th Avenue. We had a twin room with en suite shower which was lovely, I'm not sure how much less the shared bathroom is but that looked clean and tidy as well ( our room was opposite). The breakfast voucher was good - choices of bagels and pastrys, we felt like proper New Yorkers. There are also lovely diners which offer some great breakfasts. The only problem we had was when we arrived at the airport and getting a taxi. Coming from the airport the taxis have a flat rate of $45 plus toll to anywhere in manhattan - we had a guy pounce on us to tell us that the taxis were metered and it would cost us $160 and he could get us there for $78. We also ordered the car service from the hotel which was OK - I didn't feel particuarly safe when we were going down some side streets (I've read too many horrors!). We got to the airport in rapid time - I think it was just my overactive imagination. I would recommend this hotel to any people who are just looking for a place to stay and not too many luxuries.",Apr-07,260396,4,7364724,3,elw3

“The David Lynch Special”,"This place grew on me over the four days we stayed here (but it might have been Stockholm Syndrome). The room and bathroom were clean but a bit shabby. The problem was that the room had defective heating: it was about 85 degrees the entire time. The management said we might have a problem with the heat but we could open the window. They did not seem inclined to do anything at all about it and treated it like a natural disaster that was beyond their control. We did open the window but that provided a security problem and brought in huge amounts of noise from Amsterdam Street just below us. I'm not terribly familiar with steam/radiator styles of heating but the radiator was as hot as an iron turned on high and the curtains touched it. This made me very nervous. 
Otherwise, the stairs did NOT smell like urine as a previous entry suggested although if they were any steeper you would need crampons and a guide wire to get up them. The beds were comfortable and the other guests were very nice and quiet. 
The noise from the bar directly beneath the hotel and from the street was continuous and loud.

“Could have been better...”,"Myself and a friend stayed here in Nov 05. We booked directly to stay at the Murray Hill Inn. Upon arrival, they had no record of our booking even though I had printed copies of several emails from them confirming the reservation. We had even phoned three days previously and they confirmed it. They had no rooms available so moved us to their sister hotel the Union Sqaure Inn. We got there and they offered us a double room with no ensuite. I turned this down as we had booked a twin ensuite. They then moved us to another hotel, The Amsterdam Inn. After some argument they agreed to refund us the taxi fares between the hotels. 
I was not happy about staying at the Amsterdam as it was much further uptown than we had planned. When we arrived we were faced with a very very steep set of stairs which we managed to struggle up. When we got to reception I was pleasantly surprised by the very welcoming young lady on reception who apologised profusely and helped us to our room. 
It was on the first floor beside reception and was a twin ensuite. It was very clean, quite spacious and the bathroom was very modern and big. The room was facing the road and there is a fire station just around the corner so fire trucks were passing with sirens blaring several times a night. Thankfully we are both heavy sleepers!
The housekeeping staff were excellent. Fresh towels every day and our sheets were changed several times during the week. We are two very messy young girls and each evening when we came back they had lined up our shoes and put our clothes on the backs of the chairs!! Toiletries were kept well stocked and we didn't have to ask for anything. 
We met three different receptionists there on our stay and they were all pleasant, friendly and helpful. I couldn't say a bad word about them. On our departure day, we checked out that morning but we had an evening flight so they kept our bags for us and booked us a place on the mini bus to JFK. 
Also, the vouchers for breakfast were great. The bagels were yummy. I wouldn't stay here again because of all the hassle with the reservation but by the end of the stay I was much happier than I had been at the beginning.",Nov-05,260396,6,6515828,2,dmbdub
“A good budget place in New York”,"The Amsterdam Inn is a quite pleasant clean, little place in an excellent location on the Upper West Side.
Considering the prices for a hotel room in New York, we consider it a real bargain although don't expect the Ritz.
On the Plus side:
1) Great location close to public transportation ( 1 and 9 lines as well as B and C lines)
2) Pleasant staff who do their best to accommodate your needs. TJ was especially helpful in trying to find us a room with a refrigerator and a longer bed.
3) Price (about $130 a night for a bathroom with shower) is terrific for New York at around the holiday time, which is when we went.
4) Clean -- i.e. not roach infested like other places we've been (!!!) with decent furniture and a TV.
On the minus side:
1) It's in an old tenement building, so it looks forbidding and there is no elevator. YOu must walk up all the steep steps -- probbly not good for older folks though we felt we were just burning off calories!
2) Small -- we stayed in Room 401 (larger with a nicer queen bed) and Room 304 for the last night (small with a bath, but only full sized bed) and there's not a lot of lounging room -- not that you're paying for lounging room. In room 401 you will not be able to simultaneously sit on the toilet and close the bathroom door if you're over 5'5"".
3) Occasionally noisy as you can hear other hotel guests in the hallways. No traffic noise in our rooms though.
Altogether a perfectly nice place to stay as long as you understand that it's budget. But I would recommend it for anyone who just wants a clean place to stay for not much money in New York.",Nov-06,260396,52,6507078,4,ltmoira
“Nice and clean room”,"I was quite impressed with the cleanliness of the bedroom and bathrooms. The bedroom was very small but it was clean and not too bad for the price. Initially I was worried about having to queue up for the bathrooms but my concern proved unfounded since they were seldom occupied. The location was great too. The 72nd Street Subway station was around 5 mins walk. The express train to Times Square at 42nd took less than 10 mins. The area was pretty safe even at night. The downside was the steep staircase. However, you could get the staff to help you carry your luggage, which I did. The staff might not be extremely friendly but at least they were helpful and efficient.

Incredibly steep entry stairs followed by a four story walk-up to a sparse room, no glass to drink from, no waste basket, no closet and a feeling of no security from the fragile door.

“How can you not like this hostel?”,"I was kind of worried to book this hostel, because some comments mentioned it was shabby & rundown. However, I wasn't willing to pay over 250 dollars per night for a 8-night stay, so I decided to have a go with this hostel, which cost me 109 dollars per night. And worth (almost) every single penny, I think.
Let me start by saying our room was just like any normal hotel/motel room I ever slept in during my extended holidays in The States. King size bed, airco (noisy but sufficient), lots of closet space, mirrors, a tv, a fridge and a microwave. The bathroom is smallish, but nice: great shower!
We got clean, thick towels every day, and our beds were made with clean sheets as well. As an European I didn't have a clue about the tipping; we left the (friendly) housemaids/men 2 dollars each day. Hope I didn't offend them.
I'd never book one of the dorm rooms, because they seemed very small; the shared showers were just big enough to step into, not to turn around in once you're in there. But then, I'm probably not used to these kind of amenities anymore, and they were (like everything) absolutely clean, when we took a look around the hostel. I'm just not a very poor student anymore (lucky me).
The hostel itself is hostel-ish: flight of stairs straight from the street (camera/doorbell), a tired receptionist (the black guy and the white weird hair guy at night really friendly, sort-of-chief TJ wasn't) and a flickering tv in the background. 
Some posters here mentioned ""the noise"", but I honestly must say that the only noise I heard sometimes was coming from Amsterdam Avenue, where our room was looking out onto. The traffic seemed to go on all night, but I'm used to that at home and hey, it's the city that never sleeps :-) You may ask for a room on the 76st St side, in stead of Amsterdam Av.
There was absolutely no noise in the Amsterdam Inn itself, which didn't surprise me once I saw the hostel. The shared rooms are so small and there's no meeting area or anything, so everyone just comes to 76st St to sleep. And eventhough we had quite a big room, we never spent more than 8 hours there :-)
I loved the area: nothing touristy like downtown, its a relatively quiet residential neighborhood. It takes 10 minutes on either the subway (B, C ,1, 2, 3) or the bus (5, 7, 10, 11, 57, 72, 79, 104) to go almost anywhere.
However, it's only two blocks from the most interesting parts of Central Park (incl. Natural History Museum), just across the park you'll find the famous Museum Mile and Madison St shopping district. Nice walk!
There are literally dozens of nice restaurants, deli's and supermarkets in crawling distance. We spent quite some time just sitting on a bench, munching on our salami rolls from the deli, sipping our coffee, looking at all the foreign nanny's taking care of their Bugaboo toddlers. No need to go to semi-hot quarters like the Meatpacking District when you've got all this. 
I'll be back here. Just make sure you book directly with Amsterdam Inn. We booked at hostels[--] and lost our 10% deposit when we booked an upgrade (private bath), which wasn't possible at hostels[--]. Amsterdam Inn wouldn't give the deposit back themselves and made us pay all over again. They said it was a new booking, we thought it wasn't (same confirmation no and all), but there was no way to pay less (which still wasn't much).",Jun-06,260396,16,5395369,4,Jake67
“Excellent location!”,"I had read the reviews about this hotel and was curious to see how it really was. I was travelling with my 11 year old son so wanted an ensuite room. This hotel seemed to offer the best deal, especially with breakfast included. The room was absolutely fine - a double and single bed, tv, wardrobe with hangers, chest of drawers, air conditioning and very clean bathroom with good shower. It was a bit of climb (we were on the 4th floor) but nothing to complain about. Every morning we went to the local bagel shop to have our cream cheese bagels and watch the local residents going to work and school. It was great to be in a neighbourhood, away from the tourist centre (I would avoid anywhere around 42nd St like the plague!). The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful - there was no problem about leaving our bags there on our check-out day. We hired a car for the day and the hire car centre turned out to be in the next street to the hotel! There were 2 street fairs in the neighbourhood while we were there - streets were closed and stalls set up - great for strolling, eating and buying all sorts. One block from the hotel is a regular Sunday market held in a school playground - some great stalls - well worth a visit. Central Park was 2 blocks away and the choice of restaurants is endlesss, as well as super-markets for when you want to save a bit of money. I would most definitely go back to stay here - it suited our needs perfectly and I can't say enough how great an area it is. One slight word of caution - I did see one room opposite ours which was very small with just a double bed, not much space and an internal window (we had 2 windows with views over the street) - it may be worth enquiring about rooms before finalising your booking. But I would highly recommend this hotel if you are happy with a comfy bed, clean room, good location and value for money!",Date Unknown,260396,13,5325702,4,Claire43

"“Great location, friendly staff, excellent value.”","In town for the 5 Boro Bike Tour, we chose the Amsterdam Inn for its proximity to Central Park but found that it had a lot more to offer. The rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable and the staff made us feel more than welcome. Breakfasts were complimentary at a small bagelry in the next block and more than satisfied 2 hungry cyclists. All in all, we found the Amsterdam Inn to be an excellent value and would recommend it highly to anyone planning a trip to the Big Apple.",May-06,260396,0,5064268,5,User Deactivated
“Proceed with caution!”,"I would say the hotel is borderline average but doesn't quite swing that far.
My partner and I stayed at this hotel from April 14 through April 22nd, when New York seemed to be going through a heat wave, which to us Englishmen seemed more akin to sub-Sahara temperatures. The problem with the heat was made worse by the fact we had no air-con, although we were assured prior to arrival we would be blessed with such. In addition, we experienced frequent bouts of an overwhelming aroma of world cuisine ranging from Italian to Asian delights. This made us somewhat nauseous at around 9.00am on most mornings. We were on the top floor (albeit at our own request), but I think this added to the smell what with the rising stench.
In respect of the staff, I do not believe they were even slightly pleasant or helpful. The staff consisted of two women who dished out dirty looks and one with such long finger nails she could barely hand you a breakfast voucher - and when she did I couldn’t help but feel she begrudged it (they don't actually tell you of this 'perk', one must seek out the information and bear the looks of distain). The third member of staff was an older grey haired man who was strange to say the least and spent his time mumbling to himself like Jack Nicholson in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest"". 
Be aware this hotel is not equipped with elevators - it has four floors that actually equates to eight (plus the first) flight of (very steep) stairs. If you are enjoying your trip with a passive partner like me, you will need some bulging biceps and a good life insurance plan to deal with this feat. Again, don't expect help from the staff.
The room, whilst very clean, I do have a few issues. 
We paid extra for a 'Queen' sized bed. When we arrived, it looked more like a UK single. The decor, whilst basic and a trifle dated, was still pleasant. The toilet was more inviting and very clean. There was some peeling of the paintwork in the bath and we had problems with the shower door falling from the hinges once or twice. Again though, nothing a pair of bulging biceps couldn't fix so weaklings be warned. I have also developed a rash on my arms, which I cannot attribute to the bed linen directly (in fact my partner is rash free), I cannot help thinking it may have been the root cause.
The towels, although reeking of bleach, still had a number of black stains on them. I would estimate you would get 3 stainless towels out of 4. 
On our departure, we had a glimpse of one of the rooms on the first floor and it looked much nicer than ours. I don't know what kind of room they paid for nor indeed am I certain what I paid for (how can anyone be sure, really?) but I would suggest you request the first floor.
The plus points were that a maid attended everyday to replace the towels and make the bed - although we didn’t have clean sheets for 8 nights which is a little long when you consider the sweat and garlic from downstairs.
The location was great - 3 stops from Times Square and we had hardly any noise in our room from the outside but as others have said, it is New York and not New Haven!
All in all, I wouldn’t stay here again - probably because next time in New York I would prefer a different hotel for variety. Because New York is so expensive it probably isn't too bad. I do feel certain places probably play on this fact and offer accommodation on the level of which in other countries would be considered hostel or refuge like. 
My partner agrees.",Apr-06,260396,4,5003213,2,BertieWertie
“A very steep-staircase walkup!!”,"Great location, clean room, bare essentialsfor $125 and $145/night before taxes.
But - the website fails to mention that this is a walkup with horribly steep and narrow stairs. You can only stay here if you have a small carryon and you must be young and healthy! There is no lobby and you are greeted at the entrance by a flight of awful looking stairs and a bad-air smell.

“It was fine for a budget hotel”,"I stayed at the Amsterdam Inn with my girlfriend in Februari 2006. We knew it was going to be cheap and small, and it was. We didn't expect anything, so that we wouldn't be dissappointed. (We were on a budget)
The only thing that we didn't like was the bed. It was, well, noisy. Even turning around in our sleep would wake us up because of the screeching of the bed. Imagine when we, you know... It was almost impossible.
Besides that, everything was fine and cute. We got what we paid for.",Feb-06,260396,0,4829246,3,User Deactivated
“No Character! BUDGET”,"Unless you have a few hundreds of dollars to spare on a NYC accomodations, all you get at Amsterdam Inn is a tiny, modest, no character whatsoever place to sleep. It was clean, though. The window did not open, so it was a bit stuffy and smelly. The mattress was pretty uncomfortable, bed cover was a cheap, thin 'plastic' one. And, bring your own pillow! You only get 2 (for 2 people) very old and very tired thin pillows. Also, if you drive and happen to park your car at the next door parking garage make sure to mention to the cashier that you stayed at the Amsterdam Inn to get a discount ( big deal in NYC) on parking.

"“Good for a short stay, just dont expect the Ritz”","having done my research on TA, i was expecting either to love or hate this place. 
It was good. It has its downsides, but these are outweighed by its plus points. really worth considering if your in for a short stay, on a budget, and only really need a place to leave your stuff and grab a few hours sleep.
Its quite unnasuming on the outside, we nearly missed it on arrival. Entry from the street is through a door next to a bar. and you need to buzz to be let in. up a steep flight of stairs to the small reception, where the staff were generally really helpfull and friendly. Our room was on the 1st Floor, so up another flight of steep stairs. We had booked a double en-suite, and actually got a triple. not much room for hanging clothes just a small rail with 7 or 8 hangers, but enough for a long weekend's worh of clothes. the room was clean and tidy with enough room for what we needed. the bathroom was very clean and the shower was nice and powerfull. We hit lucky with the room as we were on a two week trip accross the states we had 2 large suitcases and 2 carry ons, so were able to store them on the spare bed. If we had a straight double, we may have struggled.
The heating in the room was a bit of a worry at first. we were in town when the freezing cold weather had moved in and the boiler seemed to be working over time, also the radiator had a strange widget on it that seemed to let out steam! Theres no way to regulate the heat in the room, so it was a case of opening the windows. The pipes did make a lot of noise when it was switching on/off.Also we didnt appear to have air-con. not sure if they move poortable units in in the summer, but if they dont i would imagine it can get a bit stuffy. Location is really good with bars and restaurants nearby. (the chinese Mamagoo's across the street, and the small Diner (cant remember its name) round the corner for breakfast. we used the vouchers for free bagels at the shop up the road once, but with the freezing weather, prefered to sit down to a nice warm brekkie.
I was concerned that we might not get any sleep reading all the other complaints about noise, especially with the bar downstairs (worth a visit as well), but it wasnt really a problem, we'd get back and to sleep around midnight and would be woken at about 7:30 when the neighbourhood started to come to life. 
all in all a good stay and i'd recommend again to those on a short stay and a budget.

"“Friendly and clean, but heating and noise problems!”","Based on earlier reviews saying that the rooms facing Amsterdam Avenue could be noisy if you needed to open the window, I had reserved a room facing the back and I was given this. I was very happy that I had been given this tip before I reserved a room as my room was boiling hot and I was not able to adjust the temperature in my room and had to resort to keeping the window open to cool down the room. Keep in mind that this was right before the second weekend in February and it was one of the cold periods this winter. My room was freezing the next morning because the heating had been turned off at some point during the night. I had a room with my own bathroom, but the neighboring rooms seemed to be using the shared bathrooms further down the corridor. It was pretty noisy early in the night with doors opening and closing. The room and bathroom was clean and the reception staff friendly, but I doubt that I would return.",Feb-06,260396,0,4454542,2,User Deactivated
“Great Location and Good Value Accommodation”,"I enjoyed my stay in the Amsterdam Inn-it seems to have been recently refurbished and I didn’t find any evidence of anyone working in the building so I presume all the work has been done. My room was a queen ensuite and the furthest room from reception-the stairs in this building are VERY steep and there's a lot of them. They're ok if you're in any way fit but this hotel is not for the elderly, very young or unfit. The room was large enough with plenty of storage, well lit and nicely decorated. The bathroom was small but had a very large shower. It was kept immaculate during our stay. It was a bit noisy-but you’re staying ON Amsterdam Avenue and to be honest, if you are looking for peace and quiet, any hotel on the upper west side is not really the place to go! The staff were for the most part friendly. One guy went out of his way to help me send a fax and their manageress who checked me in was lovely-very friendly, efficient and helpful. One guy was a bit rude when I tried to make a local call from my room-we’d paid in cash when we arrived and apparently this meant that we weren’t to be trusted with paying for the call-I think this was just this guy though as the fax was charged to my room. Trust seems to be an issue with the Amsterdam Inn-be aware that you have to relinquish a driving licence or passport to borrow a hairdryer or iron and you have to leave the key with reception each time you go out.
Do make sure and get the breakfast voucher (again you have to ask for this every morning-lord knows what you’d do if you got them all together!) as the bagels are gorgeous and it’s only a short walk away. The Amsterdam Inn is also only a few minutes walk from the subway so it’s a great base. It’s also really close to Central Park. The neighbourhood looked very safe and make sure to buy any supplies you need in the Fairway Market behind the hotel on Broadway-it’s an experience in itself!",Nov-05,260396,0,4144623,4,User Deactivated
“Not styley but okay”,"The Amsterdam Inn was a bit of a surprise as it looked far better in the photos than in real life. It was in the process of being redecorated so at various times wet paint and tradespeople clogged up the corridors. The narrow steep stairs were a shock and getting suitcases upstairs was quite an effort. We had a room at the front with a great view of the street (very entertaining), but the noise at night was overwhelming and we resorted to ear plugs in the end. The room was very small and plain, definitely no frills, with a tiny bathroom. But, it was very clean, the bed was comfortable, all amenities worked, TV, fridge, air conditioner (so the room was never too hot). The everyday housekeeping service was excellent; the desk staff were very helpful and pleasant, and the all important hairdryer was available from the front desk as was competitive and comfortable transport to the airport. The location was excellent, it's a great area, and it was also easy to reach other parts of the city. Don't forget to ask for your free breakfast vouchers (they're not advertised); the breakfast bagels are just about the best in town. If you're very clear that this hotel is not anywhere near upmarket status, but offers clean comfortable (if somewhat dated) accommodation in a good area at a reasonable (for New York city) price then you might find this hotel okay - definitely take ear plugs or ask for a back room.",Oct-05,260396,0,4082287,3,User Deactivated
“It was fine”,"We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. I have to say it was a good deal considering the price. The location is great. Nice neighbourhood, lots of nice small restaurants and diners around. Nice breakfast place around the corner and a good pub below the hotel. Close to the Central Park and metro stations. Nice streets to walk around. Perhaps we were lucky that the renovation works and re-decoration in the hotel were just completed. Although the room was small, everything was clean and bathroom was brand new. We got the room service everyday. Friendly and helpful stuff as well. 
I have to say that I was very nerveous at the beginning as some reviews here were negative but it turned out to be allright for us. Now some down points: We stayed in the room right next to the reception desk. So it can be tricky early in the morning with phones ringing. The windows were looking at the side street and indeed the isolation was not very good. But hey, it is not a five star hotel. People were doing their bests to serve and we appreciated it. So, if you are looking for a good deal this can be your choice with its small and cosy rooms and perfect location.",Oct-05,260396,23,4040284,3,Belgie

We ran clothes lines and hand washed clothes in room sink. We posted do-not-disturb notice, so I don't know if they clean room daily or not. Air conditioner was very noisy, but room was otherwise quiet. Looks like they do regular maintenance, and are trying to improve condition.

It was near to central park and the museums. On the Sunday there was craft / antique fair going on in the local school which looked like a regular thing.

“great budget place to stay”,"After reading the previous reviews about the hotel I was not feeling very positive about the hotel before we arrived. After staying there I would recommend the hotel as a decent,cheap place to stay in a very good location.
Based on 76th street the hotel is only a five min walk to the subway at 72nd street and so travelling around Manhattan is not a problem. 
When we arrived the check in was smooth and the man on the desk helpful. We were given a room on the top floor and to be honest it wasn't too big a deal as we are young-ish spring chickens but older guests may find the stairs tiring.
On first impressions the room was small but it was just big enough to store our 2 largish bags and all our chrismas shopping for five days.
The double bed was comfy(and I am fussy when it comes to beds) and we slept well each night-although we were exhausted every night after our travels.
We didn't experience any noise worse than to be expected when staying in New York-our room was at the back though.
There was no wardrobe but instead a rail with about 6 hangers and a chest of drawers and bedside table to store belongings.
We also had a sink in the room which was good seeing as we were sharing a bathroom.
The bathroom we used was fine,it was clean and modern and after mastering how to get the right temp with the shower, using the bathroom was not a problem. There was always hot water and we never had to wait to use the shower,there was also a bath on one of the lower floors.
The maid service was good and we always came back to a clean room with fresh towels.
Girls be warned though, that we didn't have a hairdryer in our room but we borrowed one from reception when we needed it. Also the room tended to get very hot from the radiator so we did tend to sleep with the window open, but we felt quite safe.
Two places to visit food wise are Crumbs,just across the road, a little bakery serving the most gorgeous cakes and desserts and The utopia restaurant where we often found ourselves having breakfast (across the street from the 72nd st subway- get the choc chip pancakes).
So overall I would recommend the hotel and I say this in the knowledge that I have travelled extensively all over the world staying in hostels to 5 star hotels- just expect what you are paying for-if you want a five star room then you need to pay for it,if you are looking for a clean,no frills room in a good location then that is what you will get-remember you get what you pay for!!",Date Unknown,260396,0,2943914,4,User Deactivated
“Not bad if you're looking for a cheap stay!”,"My friend and I stayed at the Amsterdam Inn for two weeks in June. On first impressions, the atmosphere was quite cold and un-welcoming from the deskperson and we were horrified to find that we had to carry our extremely large bags up three flights of steep stairs! The room was very basic, but suited us as we were out and about in New York every day. The noise at night was pretty bad, as it is situated above a car park as well as being on a busy road. I suggest tiring yourself out all day, as so you will sleep through it! Maid service was excellent, they worked very hard and were very friendly, however the towels that are replaced daily would sometimes have black stains on them! All in all it was a cheap but suitable place to stay-if you're really desperate to see New York, as we were. Not the most friendly of staff or the nicest of rooms, but it wasn't a bad place to stay.

“If you have a bad back dont stay here ?”,"Where do I start ?
After flying in from Las Vegas I thought I knew what to expect.
With 3 heavy bags the last thing I needed to hear that we were on the third floor.No ELEVATOR.When we got to the room the room was tiny Nearly 1/2 Newyork Average.Still the Room was comfortable.
Having read the reviews regarding noise I thought they were exagerated UNTIL at regulr intervals the Fire Engine on the next block ( small block) would go off or the cars would screech in or out of the car park below our window.
There was no escape from the noise.
One shared bathroom on our floor would challenge even the best cotusionist from any Circus small is an overstatement.
If you want a placecheap to get you off the streets then this is ok otherwise look elsewhere.
on the plus side this place is extremely cheap for a New York weekend $90 compared to $220 in other hotels of 3*.The bed is somewhat comfortable.
Location is excellent with the metro line close bye.

“This is a horrible place!!!!”,"This Inn is a horrible deal for the service you get. We arrived at the Amsterdam Inn prepared that it was not going to be a posh experience. What we got was much worse that we imagined. We were greated by an unfriendly desk person and then directed (be prepared to carry your own baggage up at least two flights of steep steps please)to a tiny, dark room with two very small twin beds, both felt like you were laying on a board. One was sitting at such an angle that when you went to lay on it, you rolled off...really! The towels were an odd grayish white, bordering on brown and the ""view"" was a brick wall, two feet from our window. To top it all off, our heater vented hot steam into the room, creating a sauna like experience...now, I'm quite certain that was not in the brochure. The desk person informed us he could not fix the heater problem until the next day and that he had no other rooms because our room was now ""used"" and he did not offer us any discount for the inconvience.

“Good enough for us!”,"We stayed at the Amsterdam Inn in the end of September for 8 nights. We had requested for a twin room with private facilities. 
Everything went well with the checking-in process. Our room was right next to the reception area on the first floor. At first when we entered the room it seemed very noisy. The sounds of traffic from Amsterdam Avenue could be heard very clearly, like if a window was open. We asked for another room, but they didn't have one. Good thing we brought earplugs with us! But then after we had spent an entire day in the downtown area and came back to our hotel, it seemed very quiet. And we were always so tired when we came back, that we had no problems falling asleep.
The room itself was very nice and small, but it was big enough for us and our luggage. The bathroom was great, everything looked very new. The maid-service came by every day and brought clean towels. The staff was very nice too and helpful. Helped us with our transportation to the JFK etc. So thank you for you all!
The neighbourhood was great! Lots of nice looking restaurants around and a subway station was only few blocks away. There's a nice pub in the same building where the hotel is too. You get a breakfast voucher from the hotel that entitles you to a bagel and coffee or juice in a nearby bakery/shop, which was very convenient and the bagels were always very fresh if not straight out of the oven. 
So all in all, we enjoyed our stay in the Amsterdam Inn. It's good, if you don't plan on staying in the hotel room all day, but are there only to sleep. And the location is superb!",Date Unknown,260396,7,2700557,3,Ninnukka

“What a pleasure”,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at this quaint hotel for one week.Apon arrival we found the hotel to be very clean and the staff to be very pleasant and helpful.My husband and I had a room with a private bath the room was very clean and a nice size. We love this hotel so much that we will be back often, not only beause we enjoyed our stay but beause the location of the hotel is great! right in the heart of broadway, so we were never board and transportaion was very easy as well a lot of buses and trains and cabs so it made it easy to go back and forth. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone look for that new york experience and for more bang for their buck the as the private bath also came with a breakfast voucher and staff went out of their way to make us at home.",Dec-09,260396,1,53669972,4,mrnmrsrobinson
“Disgusting!”,"This was the worste hotel that I have ever stayed in! After climbing 17 stairs with heavy luggage and no offer of assistance from staff, the room was small, linens old and worn, beds were inproperly made no mattress pads, the noise from the bar below and the street was unbearable. The shower did not work, there were no towels and no extra pillows, or any other nicety that you would expect in any hotel. We were told that we would be given a coupon for a ""free"" bagel down the street which we never received, as it turned out, the bagel place turned out to be a dump too! Do not waste your money on this dump!!!",Dec-09,260396,0,51311346,1,wenlpn
“DON'T STAY HERE!!! It's AWFUL!!!”,Bathroom was dirty. Room was freezing. HORRIBLE street noise. NO ELEVATOR! NO mattress pads on the beds and they looked at me like I was crazy when I asked for one. Sheets were thread-bare and had holes. And NO HEAT in the bathroom at all!! I am sorry I believed the semi-acceptable reviews for this place to save some money.

“Downtown European Experience”,"We accepted, but didn't need, the free l Day Gym passes being distributed outside the entrance on Amsterdam Street. This is because we received the Switzerland-type hike up an immediate flight when you enter. (Personally, I liked being off the street level. However, it took 2 flights to escape the street noise on the weekend.) We expected some of this from an uptown/downtown boutique hotel. 
We found the service to be excellent when we requested a higher floor room to escape the street noise of our 1st night. Our room DID NOT have an in-room refrigerator, but the desk manager kindly offered to share the staff refrigerator for a few small items. 
The rooms were very clean and bathrooms manicured. Continental Breakfast passes came with the room key at a location down the block. Best of all, it was only 1-2 blocks to the nearest subway stop to go anywhere in town. I would definitely stay again.",Sep-09,260396,1,48444786,4,SHEI43

"“no frils, with an intersting location”","Good place 2 stay where u can see real new yorkers going about their day. Go to Zabars for a bagel at breakfast, walk thru the park, get a pizza at Nick's, all stuff New yorkers do, and from this hotel u can do it all.
Now, onto the hotel. The rooms r really small. u have a bed, a tv at the en of the bed, and a bathroom, and thats it. u definatley would never pay this much for a hotel anywhere in the world but in New york (and maybe London).
In the future i probably wouldnt stay here again. Altho we were on the 1st floor, it was still a real pain to carry ur bags up just one flight of stairs.

“Only in Manhattan one puts up with this”,"Yes, they are friendly and common areas are very clean. The rooms are the problem.
Mine didn't have a bedside lamp so you had to keep the ceiling lights on if you wanted to read, go to the bathroom at night or just take a peek at your watch inthe middle of the night. I asked for one and they said they didn't have an extra one.
I also asked for a chair as there was no place to place the laptop (they do suggest a service at a cost) but you can only place the laptop in your bed.
All this for a room with shared bath at 117.00 dollars including tax. No breakfast of course. No elevator. So at least 5 flights of stairs. 
The bedspread looked so ancient that one has to remove it immediately. Now, noise.
The staff yells from one floor to the other and from one end of the corridor to the other and feels like they are inside your room. 
There is a huge construction site next door, deluxe condominiums and since the windows and window airconditioners are not in the best of shape (the accordion closures tattered) you can hear the construction noise all day.
This hotel should be billed as a notch above a youth hostel and should cost 60.00 a night MAX. Not a cent more for what you get.
Next time in Manhattan I will book earlier, pay more and save on other things so as to not have to give business to establishments like this.
I would recommend everyone to find better value elsewhere.",Oct-09,260396,13,46590986,1,Yurisney

But I got a good cheap clean hotel
Even though the bathroom was shared it was always clean 
The room was a single that was small but at about £35 per night it was ok and for that price you could get alot worse in NYC than the Amsterdam Inn
The staff were pleasant 
The facilitys are not of a hotel but then you are not paying usual hotel rates

Ideal for someone who is travelling alone just sleeping in the room and seeing the sights during the day and socialising at night

When we arrived we got a room for 69 plus tax so it came out to 80, pretty cheap for nyc... WRONG. The room was cheap but the quality was horrible. First we got stuck on the 4th floor so we had to carry our heavy suitcases all the way up. When we walked into the room it was small. just enough for the bed and our luggage on the floor (which we tripped over) exhausted we got ready for bed and when we pulled back the sheets the pillows had black stains on them and then comforter had pubes on it. The room was filthy. spots all over the wall, carpet comming up.

“No complaints for the price”,"Upon first arriving at the Amsterdam Inn, I saw the long maroon canopy with the name printed alongside it. The long narrow canopy led to a single door. Upon looking at that single door and the narrow staircase through the window in the door, I thought, ""Oh, Lord, what kind of hotel did I book myself into?"" I had a buzz the front desk to be let in and walk up a narrow flight of stairs to get to the there. There are security cameras so they can watch who they let in. I didn't have any problems checking in and I even got the room I had requested. It's the kind of hotel where you have to leave the room key at the front desk everytime you leave the hotel to go out. It didn't bother me because that meant I didn't have to keep up the key. The staircases were narrow as were the hallways. The room I had booked, though, betrayed what I thought it was going to be like considering my first glance at the small yellow hallways. The room was surprisingly nice and decent for the cost. I booked a room with a private bathroom and it was clean and decent as well. The room was bigger than I expected it to be. All I really wanted was a safe and clean place to sleep and shower after exploring the city. Lots of little eateries are around and Central Park is only 2 blocks away. You could hear noise from the outside but I chalked it up to the charm of NYC. I could hear people out in the hallways coming in after a night on the town but there was no partying and no real trouble. I didn't expect total silence but on the whole the noise wasn't much to complain about. It's not a bad place to stay. Everything looked new in my room. If they can keep the rooms up, I don't think this would be a bad place to stay even a year from now. I would consider staying there again.

“Solid Midtown Lodging”,"I've stayed several times at this hotel and it's become my favorite in the midtown are. Two blocks from Grand Central, it has easy subway access, it's close to the dropoff point for airport shuttles, it has an efficient check-in desk and most of all the rooms are comfortable. I've had rooms in several configurations and all have been perfectly acceptable in size and, thankfully for Manhattan, rooms are quiet. The beds are very comfortable, the A/C is powerful and easy to control and the bathrooms are well appointed (good toiletries and towels large and fluffy enough for tall adults). It's clean, well maintained and the front desk is quick to respond to issues (a broken hair dryer was replaced in ten minutes). For both business and leisure travel, this is one of my go-to stops in Manhattan. The in-house restaurant is adequate - service is good but the menu is limited and pricey (but then again, that's the norm in Manhattan). There are two computers next to the restaurant in lieu of a more formal ""business center."" There is no coffee shop in the hotel, but several within a block's walk. Door service is excellent - the guys at the front can get a cab even at the busiest times. Checkout can be a bit lengthy on busy mornings because the front desk only has three cashiers even at peak .""periods, but this drawback aside, I give it two thumbs up.",Dec-12,93593,20,147722991,4,Lyn_Farmer

We were promised a high floor and a great room. In reality it was a handicapped room with no view. As a gold member, one would expect a little better than that honestly.

"“Beautiful, Comfortable and Central Stay”","I recently stayed at the Westin Grand Central New York between Nov 29th - Dec 2nd on my first trip to NYC. This hotel is two blocks away from Grand Central Station and super close to the Chrysler building. It's located on 42nd Street and 3rd Ave and I was very happy with the location. It's nearby lots of affordable restaurants on 3rd Ave, Bryant Park is 4 blocks west on 42nd and the United Nations is 2 blocks east on 42nd. So I would consider this hotel pretty centrally located. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas and the staff were very friendly and accomodating. Our room was very big, clean and comfortable, they have the heavenly bed which was very cozy and hard to get out of in the morning. This hotel had recently been renovated and the room had everything that we would need. I was also happy because the hotel was able to give us some great coupons for shopping in the city which was great!

“Good value and was truly what you would expect in a westin”,"I stayed here in dec, which is about 2 months after it opened. The rate was one of the best around. I had requested adjoining rooms because I had children with me - they were one of the few hotels that could guarantee we would be given these rooms. It was great because the rooms are across the hall from each other and separated have the option to be separated by another locked door so no one could access our rooms at all in the night. Great piece of mind...preserved a pot of coffee in the morning and it was brought up within 5 minutes or so. Overall good property.

“Not a Westin standard hotel”,The only positive is the great Westin beds. Otherwise the Westin Grand Central is a disappointment. The rooms are reasonably sized as are the bathrooms but the staff let the place down. I stayed a week and was never acknowledged by any of the numerous doormen constantly standing around in the lobby doing goodness knows what. The reception staff are unfriendly and only 1 of them ever smiled in the week. The bar/restaurant was not open after renovations lasting more than 6 months. The concierge staff again never smiled but at least we're helpful. The room servicing was hit and miss- most days something would be forgotten to be replaced. Westin needs to do some serious staff training on service because it makes all the difference to your stay,Nov-12,93593,9,147469322,3,Ianbazza
"“An average hotel, below the usual Westin standard”","Well, where do I start ?. I had high expectations after staying in a number of Westin’s globally however, I’m afraid I left my stay at the Westin Grant Central NYC a very unhappy and frustrated customer.
Firstly, I had booked here with a group attending a conference in NYC, so all up there were 12 of us staying for periods between 4 and 8 nights, so I figure just based on the room rate we were charged the bill was USD$70,000 plus meals, drinks, dry cleaning etc.. etc.. Not to say I was expecting anything “amazing”, but an adequate service would have been nice.
First impressions are good, an ok location in mid-town, not too far from Grand Central Terminal. The hotel is reasonably modern and well accessible. The check in process was ok, albeit there were only 2 clerks on duty and a 20 minute wait after a long flight was a drag. the check-in staff were not overly friendly or warm, and I really detected an air of indifference in their attitude. Anyway, after what seemed an extensive wait we received our key and made our way to the 14th floor. 
The luggage arrived not long thereafter and we provided the porter the customary tip. Seeing we had just arrived at JFK with no opportunity to exchange currency, we offered an AUD 5 dollar note. The porter seemed miffed at this, scoured and left with barely an acknowledgement…… geez, sorry I didn’t anticipate the inconvenience I was going to cause the porter by not thinking ahead and exchanging some currency !.
As you do after being out of contact for some 24 hours, I logged on to the guest wireless internet. This is expensive at USD$15 + taxes per device per day. As my partner and I had a Blackberry, Iphone, Laptop and Ipad between us, this proved to be an expensive option. There were no discount plans available for 3 day/7 day plans either. This is quite a scam if you ask me as wireless is readily available for free around NYC.
The rooms themselves are functional. The beds are great, as I’ve come to expect with the Westin’s I’ve stayed in. The LCD screen is huge and provides a wide range of free to air and pay options. The bathroom is adequate, but a little on the small side and you could not accommodate 2 persons in there at the same time. A pet hate are the fabric shower screens which I personally find a little unhygienic.
We slept well, and ventured out the next day to do some exploring. Upon arriving back at the room at 4pm, the room hadn’t been attended to. A call to reception fixed this, but hey…. should I have to remind them of this ?. We also noticed that the little things went unnoticed, the tissue box in the bathroom remained empty for days, toilet paper was left to run low etc.
On the second last day we had left a laundry bag with a few basics to be laundered and a tie to be dry-cleaned. They forgot to collect the laundry and we had to remind housekeeping later in the day when we returned to the room. No apology, but they said they would try and return our laundry by 5pm the next day, even though it was a Saturday. Well, the laundry returned, and I don’t want to seem picky but everything was individually hung and plastic wrapped. I personally think this is excessive and the hotel should re-think it’s green credentials. My main beef was that the underwear and 3 blouses plus 1 tie came to USD$120 + taxes. Please…… I would rather an $80 service with less plastic !... ohh, and the tie came back from being dry cleaned with a stain clearly still evident.
The disaster in the hotel which will be this properties undoing is the dining room. Faulty Towers has nothing on this place. Where do I start ?. 
Firstly I will acknowledge that the dining room and bar are recently opened, and as some reviewers have mentioned, the hotel had no dining/bar options for some time, so this must be an improvement…. perhaps… ?
The breakfast offered at the dining room is very basic. It consists of a buffet that comprises the following – 3 types of cereals, 2 types of flavoured yoghurts, fresh fruit (blueberries, strawberries, bananas), hot options (scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, sausages, roast potatoes), Muffins, breakfast bread rolls. The food didn’t look particularly appetising and at USD $25 each + taxes and service, it was poor value for money.
They make it very clear that this is a buffet and that they don’t do a-la-carte, but if you ask, they will “sometimes” accommodate your requests. The weird part is that that have a chef on attendance at the buffet (all decked out in high peak chef’s hat etc) and his primary role is to stir the eggs in the server. This was weird as when I asked him for some toast, he looked at me with a blank expression and he said that he “didn’t serve”, and motioned me towards a waiter. I still can’t quite figure out what his role was ?.
I think my main complaint with this restaurant was the service. The wait staff were down right rude. For example ; My partner was up at the buffet selecting some food and when the waiter came by to serve some coffee, I also ordered a green tea for my partner. 2 minutes later my partner sat down and decided that rather than green tea, she wanted Calm tea (a mixture of chamomile tea and other leafs). Five minutes later, the green tea arrived and when we enquired about the Calm tea, we were greeted with a scorn, and told that it was too late, as it had already been made !!... lol
On our last day we attended the buffet again and after being seated, we enquired if it was possible to get a side of smoked salmon. We were greeted with scorn at this request by the waiter and reminded of the no a-la-carte rule, but he would do his best. 20 mins later he returned to confirm that the chef would “make some”. When I politely enquired why the chef was required to “make” a side portion of smoked salmon, I was given some flippant comment that “it doesn’t appear on the plate by itself” and that it takes preparation etc. Anyway another 10 minutes elapsed and we were presented with some smoked salmon, bagels, cream cheese, onions and capers……. Now I know why the chef was required to “make it”, but this was quite different to what I had ordered. If only the waiter had explained this, there wouldn’t have been an issue.
At an adjacent table, the waiter was berating a customer for allowing their 5 yo girl to pick at a plate of food when she hadn’t paid for the service …. Seriously, the food is average and over-priced and why would you bother making a big deal of this… and particularly in middle of service, embarrassing the customer and making the other guests feel uncomfortable.
And finally, after breakfast we went back to the room and then went to check out. Upon checking the bill, I noticed that the breakfast hasn’t been included. I advised the clerk of this, and he phoned the dining area to see if he could get the charge posted. After 2 attempts and 5 minutes of waiting on the call for them to answer, I went to the restaurant myself to ask if they could post the charge. The restaurant was empty and I was told that by one of the SEVEN staff that it’s not normal practice to do this until end of shift ??. By this stage they could see I was getting irate and the Supervisor came across and attended to my request for me (how hard is It to request that I be charged !!). I went back to the front desk and he then proceeded to check me out and rolled his eyes muttering something about the poor restaurant……… clearly I wasn’t the only unhappy customer.
Any finally, upon checking out, I was on a 2 pm flt, my partner on a 6pm one, so I asked for a late check-out (no problems there). The only problem was that once they did this, the internet was cancelled and despite renewing the service earlier that day for their daily flat charge, we needed to do it again.
In summary, this is a hotel with lots of potential, but lacking in service ethos. The dining room is a joke and they need to re-visit this from scratch. 
I would not stay here again. There is no way my Co. will be sending $70K here again, there are other hotels in NYC that would like our custom I’m sure.",Dec-12,93593,24,147208146,2,howard_and_bec
“One Huge Mess”,"The rooms at this particular Westin are excellent and roomy (for NYC standards). Other than that, this hotel is a complete wreck. As a longtime SPG member, I've stayed at many of their hotels over the years and can say that without a doubt this is on of their most poorly executed examples. Some of the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. The rest are just plain clueless and unmotivated to help anyone. 
I went to check in at 5pm on a Saturday, there were about 20 people standing inside the lobby (which isn't very big) waiting to check into their rooms. For some reason there was only ONE employee checking in people, but there were eight more standing around the lobby doing absolutely nothing. About ten minutes of this went by before three more employees showed up to check the guests in. Once the employees got logged into their computers, they only helped the guests in the regular line and ignored everyone in the SPG Gold & Platinum line until someone spoke up. It took 25+ minutes to get a room key. After settling into our room we came back down into the lobby an hour later and it was the same mess all over again - about 10-15 people waiting in line with only two employees checking people in (what happened to the third???). 
The doormen were particularly lazy too. I'm not really sure what these guys do. Sometimes I saw them helping people get taxis, other times I saw them just stand around talking to each other and watching other guests try to hail taxis on their own. When I pulled my car into the driveway, they didn't like the fact that I had parked on the left side (they were standing around doing absolutely nothing and didn't bother to wave my car into any particular direction) - instead they made me park on the right side, which also happened to completely block the front door of the hotel. When I was leaving the hotel the next day, there were two cars parked on the left side.
On the plus side, the concierge was very helpful. We asked for help in getting to a particular place for dinner and they pulled out a map and showed us how to travel there via the subway. 
It's pretty tough to find a good all-around Starwood hotel in Manhattan. The Times Square location is VERY busy and expensive, the W on Lexington Ave is very well run, but the rooms aren't as nice. This one should be the sleeper hotel of the bunch since the location is awesome, but unfortunately it's run poorly. Stay away until they get their act together.",Dec-12,93593,3,147093869,2,MCouper
“Another great Westin experience”,"We took the bus from Providence to nyc. From the port authority bus terminal we walked maybe 10-12 blocks to get to the hotel which really was not bad at all. We got to the hotel early in the day tried to check in but being it was 5 his before check in time the room was not available which was expected. The front desk clerk was a little short with us I think maybe a little overwhelmed, there were only 2 clerks on and a line full of people. The bell men were very curtious and seemed genuine to enjoy their jobs. The hotel is very well located only a few blocks from all the action. The beds were super comfortable as always we slept like babies and the shower was again Heavenly. My brother in law even is looking to by the same shower head for his home, and I the heavenly bed. The only negative thing I can say is that the alarm clock was still set from the previous guest and went off at 5:30 am luckily with such comfortable beds we were all able to quickly fall back to sleep.",Dec-12,93593,4,147084944,5,jgreen7317

The first time I stayed here, it was just at the beginning of the renovation and I had some issues checking in and with room, but those were related to the conversion. The second time, I stayed in August 2012 - I was there the day they re-launched the Westin. Pros: Great Westin rooms, Heavenly Bed, good amenities and service. Cons: no restaurant and bar when I stayed there (check with the Hotel), and the location is a little boring if you're looking for NYC excitement.

“It's mostly good”,"Stayed here for an anniversary weekend with my husband. This used to be the Helmsley Hotel and the location is great - 3rd Ave and 42nd - close to subway, easy walk to all the action in midtown. We asked for an upgrade (we're Gold Starwood members) and first the guy said he had nothing and then he said he had a nice room for us - the room was fine, perhaps a little larger than the usual NYC hotel rooms - it was a corner room so had a short hallway and a seating area. The bathroom was standard Westin quality with a walk in shower - but why does the tap have to be so far away that you get wet when you turn on the shower? As usual the bed was very comfy and the sheets of good quality. Our sheets were changed every day - something that does not seem to happen automatically any more. My pet peeve with ever Starwood I have stayed at in NYC is that there is often something missing after the room is cleaned - this time it was a bath mat one day. The staff must be under great pressure to get rooms done and they seem not to check when things are missing - or just don't go back to replace something.
That said, the hotel was recently redone so it is clean and shiny. The lobby does get very busy at times and it is quite small. I usually stay at the W on Lexington Ave and this is a very good alternative - I'd probably stay here in future rather than at the W which is getting old and tired. The gym here is also way better - large, clean with new machines.",Dec-12,93593,13,147055427,4,Travellingnurse50
"“The bellman was right: 'yeah, keep hoping...'”","The Westin Grand Central has potential, you can see they are trying (some of them) to make it better but it's not there yet. 
The location is superb, rooms are nice and relatively quiet. The service is so not top SPG: it seems they don't talk to each other, there must be resentment amongst the staff or maybe just disorganization.
Room ready way after 3.00 pm, late check out scheduled three times because apparently the first two were not recorded properly, SPG check in desk with a 'I wish I was not here' attitude. Yes, small things in the grand scheme but enough to make you tip-toe around the staff.

"“Great new Westin - great location, excellent value!”","This hotel was the Helmsley, and became a Weston on or around October 1, 2012. It's not huge, about 240 rooms, and our room was a very comfortable size, extremely well equipped, and met all expectations of a four star hotel. We were on the fourteenth floor, and it was quiet and we slept well.
The location at first sight seems a bit ""east"" of most the main parts of the city. Once you get a hang of the fact that the Grand Central subway station is just a few hundred yards away, that you can bus or subway up or down Lexington - etc. you are no more than twenty minutes away from either the upper West Side, Downtown, Greenwich Village, and other major sectors.
You have to try the food court at Grand Central Station for gourmet dining on the trot and at great values - you name it, and it's available! The star of the dining is of course the Grand Central Oyster Bar - an institution that serves around 40 varieties of oysters, as well as many fresh fish items - not cheap but good value, about $30 a head excluding alcohol.",Dec-12,93593,21,147047215,4,JulianSolo
“Excellent room and value for this area; staff not so much”,"Stayed for a night in December 2012. Excellent renovation. All the comforts you expect from Westin - perfect bed (firm mattress with generous feather top), comfy linens, rain water shower, comfortable sitting area, great lighting. Housekeeping was spotless,robes, in-room coffee, in-room safe, huge flat-screen TV. It was also a great value - the room is massive compared to other mid-town hotels in this price range and above that I've stayed at. If you're looking for quiet, ask for a room on a high floor in the back - I would rather deal with 41st Street than the noise from the buses on 42nd Street.
While the building is up to Westin standards already, I can't say the same for the staff. We generally found them to be indifferent at best. I was particularly amazed by a member of the front desk staff who was outright rude until she saw that I was a Platinum SPG member and made a complete 180 to being syrupy sweet. 
FYI - There is no Club Lounge and the lobby isn't much of anything. There are maybe 3-4 benches. We saw people camped out on the floor because there was no place left to sit.
Have a great stay in NYC!",Dec-12,93593,176,147031343,4,TravelCuties
"“Central location, good price”","Nice and clean rooms, modern hotel, centrally located, fair price value. - The bar is open till 4am, and even though food is not served after 10pm (why actually?), room service is available 24h. / Staff responds to complaints - What's missing? An executive lounge, where regular guests can print out a document without swiping a credit card in the outsourced internet corner...",Dec-12,93593,13,147029632,4,CenturionMember
“Poor Service.”,"I stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night and made advance reservations. I arrived at 5:00pm to find the lobby was full of people; I assumed it was a convention going on at the hotel. When I tried to check in, they told me that my room wasn't ready yet, even though check in was 3:00pm. I realized the entire lobby was people waiting for their rooms. I finally got into my room at 8:00pm and found it was dirty. Someone I rode the elevator down with said her tv was still on, and there were half filled drinks in her room when she first walked in. They told me I'd receive a complimentary breakfast for my kids and I for the inconvenience. So we ate breakfast. Now, I've returned home, and found they charged me for the breakfast. I've called accounting, and they won't return my calls. I could call it worse, but giving every benefit of the doubt, this is still very poor service.",Dec-12,93593,2,146938537,2,Michael A
“Nicely renovated”,"Just completed a business trip here and had a pleasant stay. The rooms are nicely renovated and provided a great night's sleep, although oddly the door doesn't have a tight seal with the frame and lets in light around the edges. Still a few kinks in customer service and housekeeping, but they are trying and the staff was very friendly. It took three tries to get working keys for my room, and on the third try they finally sent someone up with me and gave me points for the inconvenience. It should not command top dollar among the Starwood properties at this point, but if priced competitively I will definitely go back because the room was nicely sized and newly renovated, and the location has good access to most points in the city, plus the Grand Central amenities. Make a stop at the Duane Reade or CVS for water, however, because not even the Starwood rooms have a complimentary bottle.",Dec-12,93593,8,146917766,4,CG_ATL
“First Class”,"I booked two nights at this hotel at an exceptionally good price through Hot Wire earlier this year.
I ws rather concerned because of the reviews being posted.
The hotel is beautful - friendly helpful staff (every member) - restaurant opened for the first night while we were there - lovely meal well priced.
We were upgraded to a lovely room on 29th floor - as it was my husbands birthday we were treated to complimentary sparkling wine and chocolate dipped strawberries on the first night and compliementary sparkling water, and fruit and nut platter on the second night - well done Westin/
Great location but as our booking stated New York Helmsley there was a little confusion with the taxi driver as the Hotel name is now the Westin - but otherwise no problems at all - thank you.",Dec-12,93593,9,146892401,5,belfastcastle
“Fine If You Dont Mind Bad Service”,"I've stayed at a lot of Starwood Properties, and they are always amazing. That's why I didn't think twice about booking at the Westin in NYC Grand Central. However, even though they assured me when I booked that I would get two adjoining rooms, when we arrive our rooms were no where near each other and the man behind the front desk sloppily chewed gum with his mouth open and lazily said there was nothing he could do. Then, one of our rooms ended up being near construction and was very loud, so when we asked to move rooms, another woman at the front desk was chomping on gum and said she would reserve another room and we should check back later. When we did check back, there was no room reserved and they had to scramble to find space for us. When we checked out, they even messed up on the billing and tried to charge us for an additional night. The only person that was helpful, informed, and not chewing gum was Pei, a very nice woman at the front desk that finally helped us. While the rooms themselves were not bad, the service was pretty shocking for a Westin, I expected at lot better.",Dec-12,93593,0,146888039,3,Emily H
“Amazing Views & Great Location”,"I stayed here on business/pleasure trip and it did not disappoint. We stayed on the 35th floor with great views of the city, river, and empire state building. The rooms were quiet, the beds are AMAZING, and the location is extremely convenient. There is a 24 hour CVS on the corner across from the hotel, so if you forget anything after a long day of sightseeing or business, it's easy to access. 
Also, if you are an active person traveling for a quick business stay, they have a program that allows you to rent New Balance workout clothing and shoes for just $5 for your entire stay. I called the night I checked in and they had the bag of gear to my room within 10 minutes. I've never stayed at a hotel with this kind of convenience, so I would definitely recommend Westin Grand Central to anyone.",Nov-12,93593,2,146833476,5,Elizabeth K
“If you are Starwood Platinum Skip it”,"Thought I would try the newly renovated Westin Grand Central ( used to be the New York Helmsley) on a recent trip to Ny. While the renovation is nice - rooms pleasant enough - they have NO idea how to service their Starwood Platinum guests. I had submitted a suite night award request which they were not able to accommodate - I understand that - it was a busy week in NY. But their front desk staff Lily I think her name was told me while barely making eye contact that the property was oversold and they only had rooms with 2 double beds available and would that be okay. I said no it is NOT okay, I'm a lifetime platinum member, I've spent 86 nights this year at Starwood properties and I had a reservation for a King bed. She then was able to find one.
I will not be returning here for my 4 - 6 trips to New York per year. Stick with the W Union Square, the Parker Meridien or the W Times Square.",Dec-12,93593,3,146831984,2,Whis117
“Nice Size Rooms But....”,"The hotel has been up dated and is fresh and clean.
They lack the other touches. We stayed 3 days. When the maids cleaned the room they didn't replace things we had used such as plastic glasses etc. Our grandson stayed with us in our room. When we opened the pull out couch the sheet was dirty and there was no other top sheet or other beding. At 10:30 house keeping came up and brought clean linen. I asked them to make it up.
We wanted to check our baggage because we had to be out of our room at 12:00 and not leaving NYC until later in the evening. We waited in line 25 mins. We asked if someone could do it we were told no one was there that was union only they could touch the bags. Finally a nice lady showed up and took over by then there were 14 people in line waitng.
There is very little seating in the lobby to sit and wait for your ride.
Restrurant is open short time and very expensive. There is a nice deli next door.
Location is a ways from Time Square and the action.",Nov-12,93593,20,146815102,3,onthego1937
“Great location!”,"What a great location, so easy to walk to Times Square, 5th Avenue, Broadway and to the subway!
We stayed here for three nights, and it was great! My partner asked if we could have a room with a view and we got the Empire State Building. We had a corner room on the 21st floor at the back of the hotel and although you could hear traffic noise in the distance it did not disturb our sleep. There is a subway exit next to the hotel, but a short walk and you are at Grand Central Station and that is just beautiful. When you step out of the hotel you can see the amazing Chrysler Building and next door to the hotel is the Daily Post building, as immortalised by the superman movies
The room was spacious with a massive comfy bed. We slept really well for the three nights we were there. There was a spectacular shower in the bathroom. Starbucks coffee was provided (although only 3 sachets a day). We did not eat at the Hotel and there are some great places to get breakfast nearby, a Starbucks over the road and another place next to the Hotel itself. There is a bank 2 minutes walk up the road and this also has the well known coffee shop inside it. There are some great restaurants nearby.
Our only problem was with the concierge, we wanted to book some tickets to see a film that was previewing in only two cinema’s in New York and asked for some help to reserve tickets online as we did not have a US credit card (just UK ones). It took the concierge 20 minutes to tell us they could only do this with our card which did not work.",Nov-12,93593,4,146755697,5,Janike92
“Much better than expected”,"After reading some reviews on Tripadvisor, I was worried, but the construction is complete. The rooms were very nice and quiet.

“NYC Westin - Grand Central”,"My husband & I visit NYC almost every year for the Macy's Day Parade. I reserved my room through Hotwire & booked The Westin. Drive up/drop off area w/guest parking at a reasonable fee, almost no wait at check-in, fast & corteous employees (please don't be turned off by the operator if you call a head for information) everyone was friendly at the hotel, large spacious rooms w/a bathtub if you have little ones....& the bell-hop even pointed out the view of The Chrysler building to our son....very sweet, fast check out & I even had a good laugh w/the attendant at the front desk:) Easy travel back out of the city heading towards the east side.",Nov-12,93593,2,146709684,5,MarleseThompson
“Surprisingly large rooms; great location; nice views”,"Knowing this hotel had just recently opened up under the Westin brand (it was previously The Helmsley), I was expecting it to have a few kinks that needed to be worked out. Minus one issue with the elevators (which I'll detail below), I was thoroughly impressed with the property. When considering the high quality of the room furnishings, the large room size and the great location, I think this property is a wonderful value for Midtown. In my review I'll try my best to point out all the things I loved and the one or two things that could be improved upon at this hotel.
Things I loved:
-STYLE: The style and functionality of the room and hotel was top-notch. It is very clean and modern.
-LOCATION: The hotel is in a fabulous location. It's in midtown, only a few blocks from Grand Central Station and across the street from the Chrysler Building. It has a number of good breakfast locations nearby, as well as a CVS, Duane Reed and Bank of America. Just about anything I needed was within a block or two walk. 
-ROOM: In comparison to the standard cramped room sizes for NYC, our room was large. As you can see from my photos, the room had a small living area in it, which certainly made it feel more comfortable. The room also had numerous places to store our suitcases (one luggage rack; one stool), a full length mirror and a super comfortable bed. Our room had a view of the Empire State Building; my mother-in-law's had a view of the Chrysler Building.
-NOISE LEVEL: I heard noises here and there from the hallway, but nothing at all that was distracting, let alone would keep you awake.
Things to work on:
-INTERNET: Wi-Fi was available for $15, which is annoying. Blah.
-SERVICE: The front desk team could afford to smile here and there. We didn't use the concierge much, but they were helpful when we needed them.
-ELEVATORS: The hotel, which is probably 30 floors or so tall, has six elevators. However, during our stay three of them were not functioning, which meant that we often had to wait upwards of 20 minutes for an elevator since it was often too full to board. The concierge informed me that the computer system was cancelling the call for three of the elevators and that they needed a specialized engineer to fix it. I'm sure this is something that will not be a normal problem, but I cannot express just how big of an issue it was for our trip. 
All in all, this hotel is a definite contender if you're looking to stay in Midtown.",Nov-12,93593,25,146647674,4,kbharvey
“Really should have been a Sheridan”,"My family checked into this hotel on Thanksgiving. At the time of check in the regular guest line was shorter than the SPG line, so I went into the regular line and the clerk told me there were no rooms available and to wait. After 4 of us were standing in the small lobby with very limited seating for 1/2 hour, I saw there was no line at SPG and told my story tot he SPG clerk - she said she had a room ready fore me. Good thing I didn't rot on the vine waiting for the first clerk to accommodate us. Our room was fully remodeled, and it was nice, but not Westin nice.... it was more Sheridan nice. The gym was nice, however, no fruit in the fruit bowl. The wait for an elevator was acceptable, and a guest showed us how to hold down a combination of buttons to get an express ride down. All in all we thought the hotel was okay, but did not live up to our expectation of a $375, per night Westin.",Nov-12,93593,10,146553972,3,YandB_LabLover
“Technological gremlins”,"Technology issues affected check-in, check-out, TV service and even the elevators. The apparent ongoing renovation is diminishing the allure of this centrally located property. Room accommodations are nice but the staff seems to be having a problem providing the level of customer service that one would expect. There didn't seem to be sufficient management available to deal with customers' issues. Was there really a need for 2 different members of the housekeeping staff to check on my room the day of my departure prior to 9:30AM? Signal loss while watching TV occurred so often that I gave up attempting to follow the dialogue.",Nov-12,93593,40,146448652,3,foodjack45
“Comfortable stay”,"This Westin is very well located, close to grand central, 5th ave shopping and time square. We were upgraded to a corner room which was very spacious, clean and comfortable. For a business hotel- located across the street from Pfizer headquarters- this hotel is poorly equipped. Who is paying $1 per min for internet these days??? And no hotel phone in the business center?",Nov-12,93593,94,146406573,4,beachloverPrinceton
“Safety issue”,"Nice hotel, nice location, only one phone in the room, nothing in bathroom, phone in the room is so old and not working, asked them to change, they just re assemble it, not working, i feel unsafe if something happened , can not get help
Otherwise, fast internet
Be sure to have your soft slippers to use on the ceramic floor at the entrance of the room to avoid hurting your ankle
For 500$ per-night i am expecting higher quality.
Definitely not for romance or family",Nov-12,93593,5,146404498,3,navigator0
"“Not a bad 5 star, good location”","We stayed here recently on a trip from the UK, 4 nights, focused mostly on shopping and eating out.
I booked this hotel with points and generally try to stay in Starwood Hotels. Out of all of them in NYC, this one probably offered the best value for money, both quality and location-wise. I have stayed in the W mid-town before as well, but had big issues, so avoided that this time around.
We had a room on the 40th floor, fairly standard by the looks. The hotel has had a recent renovation from when it was the Helmsley, so was in good condition. 
What's good: Mainly the location and the fact that it has been recently renovated. Rooms are nice enough, though nothing special. The gym is good, new equipment and a good variety of cardio and weights. It's only a couple of blocks from Grand Central and there is good shopping both North and South of the hotel.
What's not so good: Bathrooms are small and lacking marble for it to feel like luxury. The restaurant out the front has not yet opened, so there's not a lot of options to eat in, or get a coffee during the day. 
Overall: There's been a lot of bad press about the lack of readiness and the poor service. This is probably deserved, but if you don't want anything except a clean room, gym, good location and reasonable price, then I would recommend this place.",Nov-12,93593,16,146375815,4,Bennyboyblue
“A great stay in Manhattan”,My husband and I stayed in this hotel in June 2012. During our stay the hotel was still under renovation to become a Westin Hotel. But we did stay in a new refurbished room. The room was really big with all the necessary amenities and a huge flatscreen TV and an extremely comfortable bed. Our room faced 42nd Street and we did hear some noice from the street... But I would really recommend this hotel for a stay in Manhattan.,Jun-12,93593,2,146364193,4,SofieBernaert
“jekyll and hyde review”,"We stopped here for 5 nights over thanks giving and our stay was a little hit and miss. The problem with this review is, HAD we have paid the premium rate $896.00 per night we would have been pretty fed up! 
However, we booked through hotwire and got 5 nights for £400.00 ($600.00) or £80.00 p/n ($120.00) and as such its very difficult to complain with any real vigor!!!
The rooms are generally nice, with comfortable bed & surroundings, however the sound insulation from the outside (we were on lvl 8) was poor, the noise from the adjacent rooms bathroom was significant and the air con was quite loud and some of the finishes are not to a great standard (see pics).
The lobby was nearly always very busy and service was slow with staff often talking amongst themselves rather than acknowledge you. The bar/restaurants were still closed, the website says that bath robes & slippers are included (They weren't) however there was an iron, board & hair dryer.
On the plus side the hotel is in a great location, central to everything and close to Grand Central Station.
Please do not waste your money on the hotels extortionate wi-fi ($15.00 per day). Every Starbucks has free wi-fi and there are two, within 2 minutes of the main lobby!",Nov-12,93593,1,146327665,3,Darren W
“NICE HOTEL BUT STAFF ARE RUDE”,"We stayed at this hotel Nov 23-26th. It's a nice hotel with nice rooms. Our check in was not what I expected at all. The woman who checked us in was very rude and not helpful at all with the questions I had about the hotel. It was like I was bothering them with my questinos. When we got to our room I was happy to see that is was clean and comfortable looking. The beds are good to sleep on. Nice flat screen TV. Limited chanels. You have to pay for wifi in your room but free in the lobby. The bathroom is small and there is no fan. The tub does not drain right so when you are showering you area standing in ankle deep water. Although we tipped our cleaner everyday for our room she did not do a great job. She never filled up soaps, toilet paper or wipped anything down. Do not eat at the hotel unless you have money to burn. Very expensive. Pax is next door and they have great food. Across the stree is a pharmacy/grocery and you can but your cold beer and drinks there. For the price they are asking at this hotel I would definately NOT recommend it. We booked through hotwire and got it for 250.00 per night. A little high for this hotel but overall it was decent. Time Sq is a 10 minute walk ( 6 blocks down 42nd then up 5 blocks.",Nov-12,93593,13,146320524,3,srsk
“A Great Thanksgiving”,"This is a great hotel that was recently remodeled. There was limited restaurant availability as that is still being remodeled and will reopen soon. The rooms are huge for a NYC hotel and the staff was great to work with. They allowed my daughter early check-in as we were meeting from 2 different places. Everytime we had a question, it was answered promptly and accurately and the staff was quick to ask if you needed assistance. Check in was a breeze during a very busy time of the year.
It is within walking distance of Bryant Park and the Theater District although it is a little bit of a hike to the Theater District. The Metro and Grand Central Station are close which allowed easy access to anywhere you wanted to go. I would definitely stay here again.
When I travel, I have a hard time adjusting to a new place and the sounds of the area. We were on the 23rd floor and I slept like a baby from the first night on. They had the best beds. My only complaint is that you had long waits for the elevator during peak hours. Elevators were packed and you often had to wait for several cars before you were able to get on. Even then, you were packed like sardines because so many people were in each car. In some ways it was comical, but at other times, it made it hard to get to scheduled appointments.",Nov-12,93593,2,146303535,4,RockyRiverCWms
“A great Surprise”,We spent 2 nights on a weekend at the Westin recently. We booked this hotel through Hotwire (midtown East neighbourhood) and got an excellent rate. The hotel is close to Grand Central Station which makes getting around a breeze. I emailed the hotel ahead of time requesting a king bed and although they did not respond to my email we were given the king. Check-in took some time but the staff was friendly. The concierge was extremely helpful and gave us some great dining tips. The room was a good size for NYC and very comfortable. We could see the Chrysler buiding from our window which was neat. The cab driver that brought us to the hotel did not know about this location so make sure you have the address handy. On the way back to the airport we took an airport bus. I can't remember the name of the company but they leave from Park Ave and 42nd st every 30 minutes to the airports. Ask the concierge about it.,Nov-12,93593,16,146297148,4,TimTim80
"“Nice hotel, great location”","I travelled to NYC in Nov to run the ill-fated New York Marathon as part of my 40th birthday celebration bucket list. Although disappointed that the marathon was cancelled (totally understandable) we still managed to havea great holiday. The hotel was part of a tour package, has a great location almost directly across the road from Grand Central Station and The Chrysler Building. Our room was large, clean and very comfortable. We had a super kingsize bed which provided for a great nights sleep. Any interacation we had with staff we found them to be very friendly and chatty and polite. We didn't eat in the hotel, Pax diner is next door and for an amazing breakfast try Pershing Square opposite Grand Central Station. Would definitely stay here again.",Nov-12,93593,5,146284675,4,IheartNYCIreland
"“Good location, service needed a little help!”","Our family stayed here just a week ago for 4 nights nov 16-19, room was very nice. We got the best rate on Hotwire.com so I felt the value was good at 180.00 a night. Only small complaint was that we didn't have enough towels for all 4 of us and housekeeping took over an hour to deliver them. Other than that, location is good, overall meets the Westin standards with comfortable beds. NY was amazing and the close location was worth it! 
Times Square and Rockefeller plaza are less than a mile away, grand central station maybe 1 city block away. Definitely a good visit!",Nov-12,93593,0,146264693,4,ConchitaLopez
“Not too bad with good location”,"Stayed here from the 9th Nov to 18th Nov. Arrived pretty late in the evening at about 7pm. Check-in and check-out was a breeze despite the very busy lobby area. The room was newly refurbished and had a nice sweet scent to it. I stay in Westin hotels wherever I travel (SPG member) and to me, this was no different than the rest so there were consistency to it. However, the only drawback (as mentioned by some reviewers) were the housekeeping service. There were missing robes, missing towels and inconsistency in how the bathroom were cleaned. I ran out of facial tissues and it was never filled for the remaining 3 days of my stay. Hairdryer and iron was faulty after 2 days of usage - I did get replacement for the iron upon request but could not be bothered with the hair dryer as I had brought my own. Other than that, the room is totally comfortable. Noise is unavoidable as it is New York City after all. 
Location wise, this hotel is perfect. It was near most of the attractions and all that is needed is just to walk a couple of blocks west and you'll find almost everything. Food and convenience stores are abundance too. 
In summary, would stay here again as the rate paid was reasonable and comparable with other hotels in the city.",Nov-12,93593,0,146209344,3,RosalindHong
“Work in progress.”,Still undergoing renovation. Rooms great. Service a bit slow at check in. Elevators slow. We had low floor and had to wait sometimes 2 elevators.

“Needs to get its act together”,"Stayed here in mid oct, just when the hotel was officially changing name. We arrived around 5:30 in the evening, we had booked two rooms, neither of them were ready, we got one room about 8 and it was 10:30 when we got the key for the other room, the excuse was that Housekeeping was BUSY.

At night, I wanted to go down for a drink but their restaurant / bar is not yet open. When we checked in we asked for a crib for our daughter and we waited for well over an hour to get it and it was already late.

“Great stay for the Parade”,"Arriving by train from CT and finding this Hotel was just across the street from Grand Central was a bonus. When we checked in at 11am and was given our room key was another bonus! I had reserved a room for 3 guests, a teenager was travelling with us but when I requested a room with 2 beds at check-in I was advise the room only had 1 bed but the agent said (with a smile) no problem I can give you a King bed with a sofa bed. Up on the 10th floor was a very clean spacious room with a great view and a sofa bed that was easy to pull out and was already fitted with extra linen. Smallish but very clean bathroom, lots of fluffy towels and delicious smelling bathroom supplies. A noon check-out allowed us to leave our bags in the room while we went to the parade and a good nights sleep gave us an early start to get a good spot ! Considering how busy the City and Hotel was we experienced very good customer service, especially from the concierge young lady who went out of her way to help us so we would make our train connection. Would come back time and time again for this Hotel and it's location.",Nov-12,93593,11,146032604,5,Victoria D
"“Good location, still needs work”","The hotel is conveniently located a couple of blocks east of Grand Central Terminal on 42nd street. It was obviously recently renovated and is in good shape. When we were there, however, they had not quite gotten their act together which, for the price they charged, was unacceptable. 
The key to our room did not work the first time and we had to go get a new one at the front desk. The restaurant was not yet open, neither was the bar. I tried to use the minibar in the room but it was locked so I called the front desk who had to transfer me to the hotel manager to unlock it. He said he would do it remotely and that it should be unlocked in 2-3 minutes but the minibar remained locked. I just gave up in frustration.
The Hyatt adjoining Grand Central Terminal was offering rooms at the same rate. We should have stayed there instead.",Nov-12,93593,31,146013835,3,CharlesV
“Just opened with a complete renovation...”,"Just reopened, I think it was under a different name, happy they changed to Westin. The room was the new Westin look, comfortable and classy and the views are great.

“Really good hotel in a great location”,"I took a quick trip to New York City broken up by a short trip out of town. I booked two nights on Priceline in the Big Apple. Both were presumably 4 star hotels and both were near train stations--one near Penn Station and the other, this one, near Grand Central.
The first one, near Penn Station, was a 2.5 star or 3 star at best. But the Westin delivered. Great rooms and great service. And since I was on the 7th floor, and close to city noise, I noted that it was quiet. 
I slept well. Felt like I was surrounded by quality. And will repeat.",Nov-12,93593,11,145897167,5,MadDog459
“Comfortable”,"Stayed twice within a week recently. Good location, in easy waking distance of Grand Central and many of the main sights. Comfortable and well-refurbished rooms, surprisingly large for NYC. Corner room on top floor of the hotel was particularly nice (an upgrade as an SPG Platinum). 
Downsides? Lobby surprisingly small and chaotic, though, and hotel reception staff really not as friendly as they should be for a Westin. Pretty weak wireless internet in room. And rooms overlooking 42nd St are incredibly noisy.",Nov-12,93593,382,145864664,4,JCW
“Great location...”,"I just stayed to this hotel Nov 18-19 for a shopping week-end with a girl friend. Great hotel, very clean, still look new! Comfortable bed, good size room with double beds (to have seen other hotels in New York or London!). Fridge was available in the room, with beer, wine, water (free), chocolate, cheese, ect. Free Starbuck coffee & coffee machine in room. The hotels also offers a luggage storage after you check out, good if you would like to do more shopping before leaving!
Down side: no wifi in the rooms, but wifi is available in the lobby and Business center (2 computers, you will be charge for use and printing). Also, during the might my friend's sleep was disturbed by the car noises & police/ambulance sirens... but I guess it is to be expected in a big city, even though we were a good 15-20 minutes walk from Time Square. Last thing, if you try to reach the concierge by phone, prepare to be put on hold for a while... You are better of just stopping by the concierge desk in the lobby.
Great location; close to Grand central, metro, bus & shuttle for airport, shopping, Rockefeller center. 
We did not eat at the hotel. Grand central station and surrounding area have lots of coffee/café places for breakfast & lunch...",Nov-12,93593,0,145858470,4,melanie l
“A good hotel”,"My wife and I stayed over a weekend in this hotel . The location of the hotel is great. Near to central besides near the Grand Central Station and subway. Broadway and 5th avenue are in walking distance.
The hotel is clean and looks brand new, probably went through a modernization. The rooms is spacious and very clean and nicely decorated. 
The lobby is a bit disorderly but we stayed just after Hurricane Sandy. So it is quite understandable that the staff were in their best mood and the physical conditions were tough.",Nov-12,93593,34,145845573,4,atesakinci
“Newly renovated & close to everything!”,"The hotel is newly renovated. The fixtures are very modern. The room was much more spacious than I expected. The concierge & other staff we're friendly & efficient. The location is great at just a few minute walk from Grand Central Terminal, 5th Avenue, restaurants, and other convienences. It is noisy outside the hotel, but it's the city, so what can you expect? No issues with noise from other guests. I recommend this hotel & would love to stay there the next time I visit NYC.",Nov-12,93593,1,145831327,5,Kristen M
“Great Potential... Under Construction”,"I stayed here over the weekend. This was previously a Helmsley hotel which is now going through a complete modernization. All the rooms are brand new and they are definitely up to Westin standards. The location in midtown is great! Unfortunately due to the construction, there is no lounge, restaurant or lobby that is open - except breakfast in the lobby restaurant and room service. There is no concierge lounge which I found surprising for a major hotel chain in NYC. This makes it basically a hotel with very nice rooms, but no NY vibe at all. I did use the new gym which is very large and well equiped. The concierge staff were excellent and all their recommendations were terrific. The room rate was competitive with other hotels of this caliber that were completely open and that is the rub. I did not hear any construction noise and there was no sign of the actual construction site, so it didn't feel like you were in a work zone. I would inquire before booking to make sure this meets your expectations.",Nov-12,93593,0,145828948,3,RobP34296
“Perfectly located and brand new”,"This hotel is perfectly located within walking distance of Grand Central Station and Time Square. The room we had was modern, clean and well decorated. Bathroom was spotless. A bit expensive though. The restaurant and the bar were not open so we had to go out for a drink (Well, it's not too bad... we were in NYC, right?)
The concierge was very helpfull and found us the mos perfect restaurant in Little Italy.
There's a Starbuck on the corner so you can have breakfast there without paying 28$ per person.",Nov-12,93593,1,145777711,4,QuebecDeltaLima
“Amazing Experience”,I booked a one night stay for my 25th birthday night and I can not say anything horrible about the hotel. The location is superb and has easy access to the subway to get downtown. When we checked in the woman at the desk made sure that we felt comfortable and when we asked for a room with a view she gave us one. The rooms and hotel smelled wonderful and the rooms were beautifully decorated. The one complaint is the elevators were quite busy and sometimes had to wait a little for them but that wasnt really a big deal for my group. It was an amazing stay and I would definitely stay here again. The woman at the desk also offered us late check out since she knew we were going to be up late which I thought was really nice.,Nov-12,93593,4,145687608,5,Worldtravelr24
“Westin: Listen to advice from your guests”,"We stayed at the Westin for a four-day NYC vacation. We were with our two adult children in one room. Not your typical Westin standard.
Firstly, parking is $60 per day. ‘Nuf said but typical in the area.
The lobby/reception was under construction when we went so there were long waiting times. The staff tolerated us, to say the least; unfriendly, unsmiling. Only our bellman was a chipper, friendly fellow who chatted with us and made us feel more at home.
We had two double beds. The room had the sink outside of the bathroom, which to me doesn’t make any sense – I’d prefer washing my hands before touching any doorknobs. There was no fridge provided but there was a gap where it was supposed to go. So forget about bringing in soft drinks or beer, unless you can drink them warm.
There was something wrong with the air conditioning or the insulation – maybe because it was mid-summer and high heat or maybe because of the construction – but all our maps were curled in the morning and our caps were damp. You can bend the chips – yum.
There was no breakfast included with the room, which was disappointing to start with. But the restaurant charge $5 for a coffee (not a mug, but a cup)! $5 for a glass of orange juice. We didn’t end up eating there – we ate at a little place adjacent to the hotel.
We were out and about in NYC from early morning until night time so we didn’t spend much time in the room, thank goodness.
The only plus is the location – walkable to Times Square, Grand Central, Broadway. The subway is just a couple of steps from the hotel, and of course, taxis abound.
I hope this Westin regains the reputation of its name – when we stayed, it was no better than a Super 8. The staff should be trained on how to be courteous to guests; it may even make them feel better about their jobs. As for food, the Westin should attract their guests into their restaurant by offering breakfast or cheaper meals, rather than repel them.",Aug-12,93593,13,145656609,3,Linda_GreCan
“Not Fully Operational Yet (at least I hope its not)”,"My recent stay at the newly-opened Westin was a little disappointing and frustrating. I usually expect very high standards from the Westin group, but this hotel is not yet operating to those standards. 
On a positive note - the rooms are newly decorated and clean, and the hotel's location is excellent. But really that is where the positives stopped. 
From a facilities point of view - There was no business center, no bar area, no breakfast (unless you have room service - and on the one occasion we used room service the food was cold). The bathrooms are tiny, with no separate shower and the towels in our room appeared to be hand-towels rather than bath towels. The lifts broke down a few times and they were often full to the point where people on the lower floors couldn't get in during busy times. In general the hotel felt like it was too full for the number of lifts available and on a few occasions there were also long lines to get a lift in the lobby.
Service is always an area where I make allowances in the US - because it will never meet the standards set in Asia, but even with this allowance the standards were not great. Our room was not cleaned until mid-afternoon on a number of occasions and sometimes even then it was not properly cleaned. With the exception of one staff member when I checked in, nobody seemed to smile and every request felt like a 'huge' deal. 
Finally, this hotel seems to have a high number of rooms, but with such a small lobby, few lifts and lack of common space it feels full to bursting. Not quite the restful experience I've had at other Westin Hotels in the past.",Nov-12,93593,33,145588285,3,Brit-abroad-in-Asia
“Very good stay”,"Recently stayed at the newly launched Westin Grand Central (was the NY Helmsley). They are still finishing off the bar in the lobby, so checking in was a bit of a racket. As a platinum spg member, I was upgraded to a pleasant corner room. All the furnishings are new and well appointed and whilst the bathroom is small, it was clean and tidy. The location is very convenient and I would certainly recommend staying here for business or pleasure.",Nov-12,93593,55,145547576,4,goco
“Superb Hotel and staff”,"My Wife and I stayed here for the New York marathon, which unfortunately was cancelled. The staff were fantastic, friendly and polite. We had to stay an extra night due to flight cancellations and were given the same room (after already checking out earlier in the day!)we were not charged a cent to stay and they couldn't do enough for us. A superb hotel with great staff, I can't understand the complaints on here, I suppose some people are just too hard to please!!",Nov-12,93593,0,145475201,5,bippi7
“Great location for business trips”,"I recently stayed at the Westin Grand Central and enjoyed it's proximity to mass transit. The Grand Central terminal is a great place to grab a drink, grab the subway or just pick up a snack to enjoy in your room. 
The room was average but the sheets and pillows were luxurious. The bathroom was spacious and very clean and there was a huge walk in shower. I would definitely request a higher floor - being right in 42nd street = lots of traffic noise.",Nov-12,93593,2,145473753,3,sweetladyjane_8
"“Great location, but beware of additional charges”","I stayed at The Westin from Saturday to Monday in early November with a girlfriend. We booked a room with two double beds through Hotwire for $163 per night. 
Some of the extra charges you may incur while there:
There is no complimentary breakfast offered, but breakfast is available through room service. For a typical American breakfast (i.e. eggs and bacon, etc), they charge approximately $25 + taxes + service fee ($6) + 15% gratuity. We opted to have breakfast out instead.
Internet service is not complimentary. There is complimentary wifi available in the lobby only. If you'd like internet access in your room, they charge $14.95 per 24 hour period. This should give allow you internet access on two devices. It only worked on one device for us for some reason. We mentioned this to the concierge, but she wasn't helpful. All she said was that it is supposed to be valid for two devices and offered no further help when we told her it only worked on one device.
Parking at the hotel will cost you $60 per night. There is a private parking company (Quik Park) behind the hotel that charges $41 per night. I don't know if there are others close enough to the hotel that charge less.
This last one was a huge surprise to me. They charge $1.50 for each local call you make using the hotel phone. I expected local calls to be free of charge.
The hotel is ideally located within a (casual pace) walking distance of about 30 minutes from the Broadway / Theatre District / Times Square and other attractions. There are subway stations just around the corner or down the street. There is also a CVS pharmacy down the street that is open 24 hours. 
The room was modern and clean. Toiletries were provided. The only drawback is that we could hear sirens from police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks from our room on the 12th floor. Overall, we were very comfortable.
The concierge and front-desk staff at check-in were not very welcoming. I did not see a single smile nor detect a friendly tone. They were polite with their words, but not with their tone or demeanor. They should work on their people skills.
Mattresses and pillows were quite soft. If this is your preference, then you're in luck. If you prefer firm mattresses and pillows, then your sleep may be uncomfortable.
Overall, it was a good experience and I would recommend this hotel. Just be aware of the costs associated with certain services (ex. internet, local calls, parking, etc).",Nov-12,93593,14,145388576,4,frenchie70
“Good location - Good service”,"Stayed at this hotel while it was being taken over by Westin. It was still the Helmsley hotel when we stayed. Hotel is well located, close walking distance to Grand central station and subway stations. The room was clean & spacious with a fantastic view of the Chrysler building. The staff were very nice & helpful. We had booked this hotel via a rewards plan and didn't pay for the room. We drove in NY city and had to park our car. Parking was very steep: $70 a day ! However when we had booked the hotel the price listed on their website was $50 so after speaking with the manager we were given the rate of $50. Their rates had gone up in the meantime but they were very nice to accomodate us. We had a small problem with our room safe and within 10 minutes of calling the front desk the repair man was in our room fixing the issue. 
The service we got while staying at this hotel was very good. We had a very pleasant experience.",Dec-11,93593,57,145147363,4,Twilight2Twilight
“Getting up to speed”,"Stayed here a few weeks ago. They're still working out the kinks. Great location, and far enough away from the tourist craziness of Broadway to be good. 
Rooms are up to Westin standards, which is to say that the decorations are nice. It's hard to retrofit a NYC hotel to make it feel ""new"", but it does feel like a Westin which is what I expect as a loyal Starwood patron.
The restaurant/lounge was not open yet when we were there, although they did have a limited room service menu. 
It's a Westin in midtown Mahattan. If you go there expecting a large room it's your own fault. But it was functional and clean, and I've certainly stayed in smaller rooms in NYC.",Oct-12,93593,3,145071124,3,nmhen
"“Grand Name, Not Grand Westin”","As a Platinum SPG member, I hold Westin to a certain level of service. I understand NYC is recovering from Hurricane Sandy days before my arrival. But, simple, communications should be available.
Specifically asked @ Business Center before arriving, was informed by your staff via email, exact location, & would have access. Arrived to find out it is not open, currently a storage closet, can use the 'hallway' as a work location.
Your restaurant/bar is not open, SPG breakfast perk, not a perk, 8 small pieces of fruit, 3 pieces of toast and coffee, really?!
Needed a refrigerator for specific items that have to stay cold, profile indicates this requirement. Was informed NO, and none would be provided I will be changed if I take anything out of the wet-bar.
From a security point, make sure you keep the door latch on, as the maid service will knock once as the are walking into your room. They didn't wait for an answer on 3 of the days, just started walking in the room.
Needed directions to MetLife stadium, asked the front desk to leave message for Concierge service to provide me the information under my door in the morning or call me after a specific time in the morning, was informed I would have to go talk with them in the morning as they are not around 'at this time' Sorry, that is a simple request, leave them a note, a guest should be able to request a note be put in their inbox. Never got the information or call.
Recommendation, close the hotel until you are fully operational, currently not worth $415/night.",Nov-12,93593,8,144936067,2,BPW1970
“Great Hotel in a time of Need”,"This was the first hotel that i saw coming down 42nd street and 3rd Ave in my car after i was evacuated from NYU Medical Center with my wife and new born baby. While our home is in brooklyn, with all bridges and tunnels closed off, we were essentially ""Trapped"" in Manhattan with a newborn. With no where else to go, the Westin was there right in front of me, took the wife and baby, walked right into the chaotic busy Westin lobby and asked them for a room to seek shelter for a few hours while showing them our newborn. They acknowledged right away and gave us a room. The room was better than we expected and it felt like an actual vacation.

“A great new place to stay in the heart of the city”,"Let me preface this review by saying that the hotel just opened in October 2012 and that I stayed here during Hurricane Sandy.
As a newly opened hotel, everything was spotless and attractive. The public areas were a bit cramped, but functional. Rooms were relatively spacious, and I ended up having a great view from the 40th floor (out of 41) of Lower Manhattan, including a clean shot of the Empire State Building.
In regards to the hurricane, I have to applaud the efforts of the staff. They really handled everything expertly, and I was impressed by their hospitality. First, the hotel has its own generator, which would have come in handy should the blackout have reached 42nd. Second, they modified their services to make the best of the situation - dry cleaning was halted, as was room service, but the restaurant was converted into a buffet and housekeeping was reduced but not eliminated. Third, they went out of their way to make everyone comfortable. They turned a conference room into a movie theater for children, and they opened up the other conference rooms for people to work. The lobby was filled at all times, because neighbors who were impacted by the hurricane and blackout were allowed to shelter. Amazing job by the staff to handle customers and neighbors professionally.
PROS
- One of the newest Westin Hotels in the city, it's very modern and well decorated
- Location near Grand Central is perfect for tourists, who can walk to Times Square or hop on the subway
- Great value considering that many other hotels are priced higher and don't feature as many amenities
- Handled the hurricane like true professionals!
CONS
- Can be a little difficult getting a cab at times (but that might have been related to the hurricane during my stay)",Oct-12,93593,3,144659988,5,EvilDrew
“WOW”,"I'm a New Yorker and when Sandy hit, I was without power or running water. The Westin transformed their ballroom in to a charging area for displaced NYers - I was able to go every evening and charge my cell and laptop, and even download a movie with the free wifi to watch when I got back to my apartment (after the 20 flight hike, that is). There was fresh water and plenty of seating. They even set up a mini movie theater for folks to have some entertainment. This simple act of kindness during a devastating time is extremely appreciated. I will now stay at Westins whenever possible.",Nov-12,93593,2,144646973,5,felicia f
“Generous in a Crisis”,"My husband and I live in NY and were without power during Hurricane Sandy and discovered that the Westin was offering free Wifi, power strips to access outlets to recharge and movies to entertain kids in a couple of their conference rooms. And access to their always clean bathrooms! The hotel didn't have any vacancies but this was the next best thing. They made a very hard situation much more tolerable and we were incredibly thankful for their generosity.",Nov-12,93593,1,144636555,5,nyshopgirl8
“Fantastic Hotel”,"We were displaced from our apartment during hurricane Sandy and were lucky enough to get a room at the Westin. The staff was fantastic - when we checked in on Tuesday, the lobby was full of people who had arrived just having lost power and water and the staff was very upbeat, helpful and friendly. The line moved quickly and we were very soon settled into a clean room and warm shower after a long day.
We were forewarned that day that with the subway's down they were operating on a skeleton housekeeping staff. At no time would we have noticed this without being told - the rooms were spotless and service always excellent. The free wifi was a very nice touch as was the movie room showing films all day to entertain people who had not planned to be in town / out of their homes. We also took advantage of the "" Westin workout gear lending program and borrowed work out clothes that we had not packed to use the gym - as did many other people we met in the gym in the matching gear. 
Throughout our time there we kept commenting on how helpful and efficient the staff were at a time that the hotel was full to the seams.
We are New Yorkers and would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to any visitors coming into town - the location is great - we walked many places from here, the room sizes very good for NYC and the staff and service excellent.
As one guest we were talking to in the meeting room that they openend for guests to work in in the after the storm said to us ""they have been amazing and keep saying they are on a skeleton staff - i cant imagine anything that they havent taken care of"" we couldn't agree more .",Nov-12,93593,1,144635732,5,julie f
"“Location, location, location”","Located two blocks from Grand Central Station, this hotel was perfect if public transportation is used to get to New York City. Newly refurbished, the hotel was beautiful. The staff treated us well, but there was something missing. Little things like a quirky elevator, room keys that didn't work and a general feeling that the staff was on edge, especially, the bellhops and doormen. Cabs were hard to come by.

“Mother/Daughter Weekend”,"My mom and I had the pleasure of staying at the the Westin New York Grand Central on its inaugural weekend. While the hotel was in the middle of construction that weekend, you would have never known. We requested early check-in and the hotel was able to accommodate us. The staff was friendly and the rooms were large, bright, well equipment and newly remodeled. I'm not a coffee drinker but my room had a coffee maker with Starbucks coffee. Our room had 2 queen size beds that were very comfortable, so comfortable that you might consider purchasing the bed and bedding from a catalog in your room. In addition, the hotel had a great workout room. It was even equipped with a rowing machine. If you forget your clothes, don't worry because the Westin can lend you clothes for your workout!!! 
The location on 42nd was amazing with great shopping and food near by and within a 5 min walk to Grand Central station. We highly recommend this hotel and plan to make it our home base on our frequent trips to NYC!!",Oct-12,93593,0,144508063,4,JAXGirl44
“Displaced after Hurricane Sandy”,"I'd like to take a moment to tell you about 2 women who made a terrible event into one that can only be described as a blessing. I was in NYC during Hurricane Sandy as a resident of the area and thought I could weather the storm...unfortunately without power that was near impossible. After deciding to walk down 52 flights with my dog and a few items of clothing...we ventured into the aftermath to find a hotel. After being turned away 3 times in the neighborhood for lack of rooms...we found the Westin which recently converted from the Helmsley...and had little faith that we could be accommodated. Then we approached Alex...who was very kind...offered me a hot beverage, a warm demeanor and luckily for us she fell in love with my dog! After being put on a list of people waiting their turn...she continuously updated me on the estimated time for check-in...hard as it was with Marathoners also seeking refuge...she introduced me to Lily who was also a dog lover and an overall sweet woman...and reassured us we would be ok. We were given a great room...with an even better discounted rate...and were reminded about the kindness of strangers in a difficult situation. During and after our 5 day stay...both women asked if my expectations were being met...and remembered both my name as my pets as well...and made the chaos outside seem like a hug from am old friend! I will keep them in our prayers...as they kept us in their thoughts with hundreds of other guests daily.

“Nice Place- Stayed during hurricane Sandy”,"I stayed here a couple of nights last week because I had to stay in Manhattan to be sure I could get into the office during the hurricane Sandy, my office is nearby on 42nd St. This used to be the Helmsley Hotel but got redone and became Westin just a month or so ago. The room was really nice, everything was brand new so I couldn't complain. I had the standard size room with king bed and it also had a small pull out sofa and some chairs. Room has a coffee maker with Starbucks coffee and they always had free Starbucks coffee in the lobby which was nice. Staff was very friendly and as I mentioned I stayed during Sandy and at times the lobby was filled with a lot of people who had checked out but could go no where due to airports being closed, the hotel was very accommodating of all the extra people hanging around, even bring out a lot of extra coffee in the lobby to keep everyone happy and warm. The hotel is right on 42nd st and is in a convenient location for both business and tourist travelers. Grand Central Terminal is just a block away, hence the name.

“The Westin Grand Central has the worst service of any hotel I have ever stayed.”,"The Westin's website falsely advertises that their hotel near Grand Central possesses amenities and features that do not exist. Don't pay extra for a ""deluxe city view"" room because you will be staring out your window at one of the buildings next to the Westin New York Grand Central. And don't bother asking hotel management why you're not getting what you paid for (the ""spectacular city view rooms are extra $$$$, of course). You will likely be lectured by one of the managers.

The computer room, with free computer access and wifi, was especially appreciated.On check-out, I explained that I was off to the airport unsure if my flight would operate and was told that this was no problem and that the hotel would not charge me, provided I called to cancel my reservation by the end of the afternoon. The staff that I dealt with during the chaos of Hurricane Sandy were very professional and seemed completely unfazed by the stressed visitors around them .

“Surprisingly great.”,"I was never a big fan of Westins but this hotel was so terrific during the chaos of Hurricane Sandy, I'm changing my mind. The hotel was overwhelmed with displaced New Yorkers and marathoners, both groups facing uncertainty. The staff was upbeat, warm, welcoming, efficient. The room was nicely appointed and comfortable. , The hotel management bent over backwards to help everyone. I was uncertain how long I would need to stay and even though the hotel was full, I was told I could stay as long as I needed and leave when I was able. They supplied free wifi and services for families. Just great.",Oct-12,93593,5,144348407,5,NYC1952
“Classy and Relaxed!”,"Durning hurricane Sandy the Westin was amazingly accommodating to the New Yorkers in the area. The Hotel went out of their way to welcome hurricane weary nyer's with an free Internet lounge in one of their conference rooms. They set up a plethora of electric outlets and even gave us water and access to their sparkling bathrooms. The entire hotel is sparkling clean, relaxed and welcoming. The staff is great, although they didn't have an easy job dealing with pissed New Yorkers after a hurricane, they always smile and ready to help you with anything! 
Truly a great experience compare to other snobby (and old) hotels in the area.

“Housekeeping left much to be desired”,"Stayed for a promotional weekend. The location is not too central as it's in Turtle Bay. The high floor room facing north (42nd Street) has a good view of the Chrysler building and pretty quiet. Bathroom, while on the small side, quipped with an amplifying mirror, is very bright. The same goes for the room, which is a nice change from other 'trendy', aka dark, hotel rooms that we've stayed recently. 
That said, check-in was a 30-minute wait. Maybe it's one-off but the lines and wagons with luggage made for a cramped lobby. 
And housekeeping was hit or miss - one day no wash towels; the other no replenishment of toiletries. It took couple calls and over an hour to get the supply. In addition, the safe was broken - maintenance had to unlock it upon checking in, but it closed by itself quickly enough before we even put stuff in. So we informed them and decided not to use it.

"“Compassion during ""Sandy"" / Westin Grand Central”","Staying at Westin Grand Central.. All newly re-furbished.. was Helmsley something! Nice, clean, lovely rooms. The management needs big praise here..So, Instead of using their fully powered facility to ""gouge"" $$ as so many NY retailers are doing, they to their credit, have opened their doors to the public, guests and non-guests, to use their WI-FI facilities and have made their meeting rooms into lounges for all needy, to rest, use bathrooms, Wi Fi etc etc.. Even showing kiddie movies to those desperate folk who have no power or supplies at home...
Once in a while does one see such decency by management in these kinds of circumstance, and they should be rewarded with great customer loyalty down the road. Nice!",Oct-12,93593,3,144176592,5,ZdenkaRK
"“Good location, comfortable hotel”","The hotel is undergoing some renovation but we did not notice any of it during our 3 night stay. The staff we found to be friendly and helpful, we weren't rushed or hurried along. The room was very clean and smart, very comfortable huge bed and there was also a sofa, armchair, desk and chair. Bathroom was clean and not cramped. The location of this hotel is perfect for midtown as it is right near chrysler building and grand central. Easy to walk to most attractions or nearby to a subway if you want to travel on metro. Or you can ask the guys outside to get you a taxi very easily. The reason this did not get 5/5 was because as another reviewer wrote, the fridge is only big enough for the mini bar and you cannot keep anything in there because in moving the content of the mini bar you are charged so don't do this unless you want to purchase - its all automatic. Also I don't think for us the bar area generally was open as when we rang to order a vodka drink they advised ll they could do was wine or beer. Aside from these niggles the hotel is very good and we would recommend.",Oct-12,93593,11,144131898,4,browngate
“Not coming back”,"I had several problems at this hotel. First, they (double) charged my credit card although I paid through Expedia, and without my authorization. Second, they stated that I would get Starwood points, but I did not (you don't get points when booking through Expedia). Third, they were quite unhelpful with mini bar. They refused to add diet cokes (there was only one) and if I got them at CVS and added my own drinks, I would have to remove the existing drinks, so I would end up paying for sodas I did not drink. To clean up the mini bar would cost $25 per day.",Oct-12,93593,1,144026272,1,GI22
“A nicely reincarnated Helmsley.”,"The interior of this hotel is noticeably nicer than it's old badge. The Queen of Mean's place is no more. The rooms are well appointed and beds are comfortable. The lounge looked nice, but, we didn't spend any time within the actual hotel. If you can score this property at the right price, I would say, do it!

“Week at the Westin/Helmsley”,"Our week's stay was tremendous. We were given an upgraded room as it was our anniversary.The lobby/entrance area was being renovated due to the name change from Helmsley to Westin although we weren't informed of the change and thought the cab had brought us to the wrong hotel. As such, there was no restaurant or lounge but there was a breakfast area. The room was large (for NYC) and well-appointed with a great view. The shower was quite stylish. Elevators were fast. Staff were courteous and friendly and everything we wanted was done promptly. We have been to NYC many times but this stay was the best.",Sep-12,93593,0,143726820,4,John L
“Wish I knew then what I know now!”,"I was pleased to learn that I would be staying at a Westin Hotel as I have had very good experiences at Westin in other cities. However, I am extremely disappointed with my stay. I knew it would cost $60 per night for valet with no in and out service. I did not know and was not told that I would be charged an extra $10 each night because they considered my small suv ""oversized."" I did not receive my SPG points for any of my incidentals because the rude front staff person refused to take my membership card. The room was okay but it was disappointing that, like so many other hotels now, there was no room in the minibar to store some water as a charge would be added to our bill for anything moved in the minibar. Arrived after 11:00 pm and there was only a limited room service menu available.

“Great hotel except for the NYC noise”,"Stayed in the hotel for 3 nights with my husband and our two year old. Loved the hotel and the room ... we stayed on the 6th floor and had a king sized bed and a sofa bed for the baby to sleep in. The room was very large by NYC standards, very new and very clean. The hotel staff could be a little friendlier but was not bothered by that much. Everything would have been absolutely perfect and would have given the hotel a 5 star rating except that there was intermittent noise from ambulances, firetrucks, police, garbage trucks .... regular NYC noise but enough to interfere with sleep if you are not used to it. I bought earplugs and solved the problem that way.....",Oct-12,93593,11,143451498,4,Jelena2011

“Not a full review- but negative”,"Going to the city for a weekend... had a reservation here. I made it with some reservations (groan, sorry) knowing that the hotel had recently reopened as a Westin; sometimes it takes a property a little while to get its legs under it and running as you would expect.
Decided at the last minute to cancel and stay at (famous hotel on Central Park South) instead.
My email from Westin said I had until 6pm day of check-in, Friday, to cancel.
Went to web site at 8pm on Thursday to cancel, and the web site said I had until 6pm THURSDAY to cancel.
Called Westin 800 number to straighten it out and they said I had until 4pm Thursday to cancel.
So three different sources, three different times, and I was naturally upset by this point. Called the property directly. Hotel operator puts me through... to the central 800 number again, even though I had said I needed to talk with someone at the property about the reservation.
Called the property directly AGAIN. Was very specific and asked for the front desk. Phone rang... and rang... and rang... after 5 minutes of ringing, the operator came on and apologized- but didn't offer to take my number for a call-back. Waited another 3 or 4 minutes and finally a front desk staffer came on.
She was gracious in apologizing for the delay. Explained the situation and she went ahead and cancelled the reservation without any charge. I told her I really hoped the hotel would get their stuff together and get her some help, soon!
So that's my review. Can't say anything good/bad about the property, only that dealing with them was very frustrating, that the info they email does not match the info on the web site, and the info at the central 800 number doesn't match either of those. Appears that they are also understaffed. Will be very leery of booking into this property in the next few months.",Oct-12,93593,10,143162421,2,BlueEyedBuddhist
“Not quite ready for prime time”,"Great central location, and possibly a decent hotel at some time in the future, but for now, they are not quite ready for primetime. Zero recognition of SPG Platinum status. Lots of nuisance problems - inconsistent housekeeping - no shampoo one night, no towels the next. The restaurant/lounge is not open, but they offer room service.....but there was no menu in the room. They do offer breakfast, but it was like watching the keystone cops, service was absolute chaos, with the added pleasure of a mandatory 18% gratuity. The final insult - a $50 fee for using the minibar as a refrigerator....yep the teenager put something in there, but $50? The front desk assured us there was a letter describing this fee in the room - perhaps in the same place that housekeeping put the room service menu?
It was just an irritating 3 nights here. Maybe in the future, but for now, there are lots of better choices in the area.",Oct-12,93593,19,143153775,2,al9249
“Needs Work”,"While this hotel has improved since its days as the Helmsley, it has a long way to go. The rooms are among the most noisy that I have experienced in NYC. Construction and road noise can be heard throughout the night. The windows in my room literally had a gap between panels that allowed a tremendous amount of noise to enter the room
Guests should know that there is no hotel restaurant or lobby bar. While there are great options nearby, it made things difficult to have no meeting place for casual business meetings.
This may get better but for Starwood loyalists, there are better choices.",Oct-12,93593,20,143144428,2,DENTraveler01
“Terrible service and wrong debits!”,"My credit card was debited wrongly two times (USD 213.52 each time) by the hotel on 14 aug 12. One of the wrong debit was corrected late aug and the other debit was only corrected recently in oct 12. I have to chase and chase for the correction. It took about two long months before the wrong debits were corrected!
In addition, it is not enough for the hotel just to refund me USD 213.52 x 2. The hotel need to refund me the loss due to difference in exchange rate, as a result of the wrong debits. The hotel should ensure that I am paid back in SGD the same amount of SGD that I am wrongly debited. 
I am wrongly debited for a total of SGD 550.36 (= SGD 275.18 x 2) but the hotel is crediting back to me only SGD 266.20 x 2 - this is not enough. The hotel need to compensate my loss (SGD 275.18 – SGD 266.29) x 2 due to exchange rate difference as a result of the wrong debits. Without the wrong debits, I would not need to suffer the exchange rate loss. I should not suffer a loss due to the hotel’s wrong debits. 
 
No doubt the exchange rate difference is due to the bank, I should not be penalised because of the hotel’s wrong debits. I have re-confirmed and confirmed with the hotel staff during my stay that I will not be charged wrongly. They re-assured me but this is what happened. I am so disappointed that this get so long to resolve and I am still not compensated to a not worse off situation. Response to email is slow and the hotel is ignoring my concern and reasoning. This is so disappointing.",Aug-12,93593,2,143137684,1,587Chawanmushi587
“Lots of promise but.......”,"I stayed at this hotel twice in consecutive weeks, the first as they were trying to complete the restaurant/bar reno and the second while they were waiting for a City license/approval. 
The hotel has been beautifully renovated and the rooms are clean and fresh, the Westin Way!
I have a couple of complaints, though. 
First, the menu is really inadequate for a full service hotel. I place some of the blame on an unfinished kitchen but still ...... Also, the prices are really unreasonable when you consider the lack of menu choices. 
Second, my check-in lady told a fib. I requested my previous weeks room which was not available th lady said I was getting a nice quiet room with a great view - that means a handicap accessible room with he weird layout. Nice room, but no lies next time please even if they're little white lies. 
Lobby service is confusion - lots of staff milling around, including managers, and causing the entrance to feel crowded. Also, not very friendly. 
Finally, and most annoyingly, the Internet connection is atrocious especially given my experiences at other Westin's. It's criminal that they charge $15 per day for a connection that's so slow, it took me 30 minutes to download an email - I even tried it at 3 am and it was slow as molasses. 
All in all, ok for a business trip but definitely not family friendly - the Residence Inn by Bryant Park is a better choice especially with young ones.",Oct-12,93593,10,143085997,3,Kenyans
“A Nice Hotel in NY”,"I am a frequent guest of Starwood hotels, this is my first stay at this property, which just reopened under the Westin brand, formerly a Hemsley hotel, rennovated and refurbished. 
MGMT and staff are very good to excellent, there are some minor issues that they are ironing out with staff training as respects to the Starwood ways and how Starwood treats their loyal guests. the staff are from the prior hotel. The GM -whom I met seems to be Excellent and knows what needs to be done.
Comfort - the rooms were comfortable, Westin Heavenly Beds, quiet, you can't hear anybody. The showers were a nice size.
Fitness center had plenty of equipment and space and clean.
They are rennovating a new Dinning and Bar facilities, not open yet, but soon.
There are a number of dinning and pubs near by. Also your around 5 Blocks or so from times Square.

“Good renovation and conveniently located”,"My wife and I made a quick in-and-out trip to NYC for a Saturday event and decided to spend the previous night at the Westin. The location couldn't be better unless you intend to spend all of your time in southern Manhattan. The hotel renovation is very nice, although when we were there they hadn't opened all of the restaurants yet. Just check ahead depending on what you expect in that regard, The rooms themselves are large (and very clean due to the renovation) by NYC hotel standards. A big factor for us was the price. It was very reasonable for a mid-range hotel in Manhattan--hopefully that wasn't just a promotion rate. I would definitely stay there again provided the prices remain where they are.",Oct-12,93593,2,142868133,4,3Bean3
"“Doesn't seem very ""Westin-y""”","I'm not sure what to think after staying here for three nights with a friend. Although the switch has been made to a Westin, it doesn't seem like it's quite there yet.
I stayed with a friend in a ""Deluxe"" room with two double beds. The room was a good size for NYC, and was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was nice and clean as well. Nothing special, but nice. The fit and finish of the room/bathroom were a little bit lacking. Not terrible by any means, but for just completing a massive renovation on the property, there were some pretty obvious shortcuts taken (not in design or materials - in workmanship). I guess the attention to detail wasn't 100% there.
By far, my biggest complaint about the stay was the beds. I've stayed in a pretty good number of hotels over the years, and I think I slept the WORST in this one. I couldn't quite put my finger on it - but it was impossible to get a good night's sleep, and I had a sore back for six hours every day. I can sleep just about anywhere, but this was B-A-D. Westins are supposed to be known for their beds, so I didn't quite understand this. They were so bad in fact, that I canceled a scheduled stay in December and made reservations elsewhere.
Some other comments:
* The towels/washcloths looked like they were 15 years old. They were thin and rough and some had some pretty gross stains on them (I don't even want to think about what they could have been).
* The staff was all extremely nice and helpful. They were responsive and always a step ahead.
* The room also has about 25% of the outlets it should have. This was a design issue that there is really no excuse for other than not having the money or wanting to spend the money. Come on guys...it's 2012. Having to take turns charging laptops and having to charge your cell phone in the bathroom just doesn't make sense when the hotel literally JUST went through a major renovation.
* The location is awesome. Two blocks from Grand Central, almost across the street from the Chrysler Building...doesn't get much better than that (unless, of course, you don't want that).
* As usual with the higher end Starwood properties, the minibar and WiFi are insanely expensive.
Overall, I would say it was a great stay, but the incredibly bad beds were a deal-breaker for me. Unfortunately, as good as the location is (and it is REALLY good), I doubt I will be back. I really wanted to like this hotel, but being tired all day and having a sore back just isn't worth it.",Oct-12,93593,7,142821009,3,bsannich

Room and furnishings were nice and very clean. Bathroom had new vanity and tile but old tub. Staff very nice, in our experience. Only complaint was checking out late (at 1) only had 2 people at front desk so line was long. Didn't have enough doormen either, so cab line was well behaved when he chaperoned us. But when he had to leave to help unload arriving car, all hell broke loose among the guests skipping the line to jump in ahead. Not the doorman's fault. And it was a very tough weekend for cabs.

"“Scratchy sheets, hard bed, sleepless night”","For a new hotel this is shameful--at one time the Westin's were known for their 'heavenly beds' but this new property seems to have opted for the lowest possible quality. I stay in a lot of hotels (so far this year, 84 in Starwood Properties alone) and recognize there is a range of quality. What i don't understand is why they opted for the lowest quality in a new property.
Other signs of lower quality: I called the front desk upon my arrival in the room as there was no internet (it said i the room had not yet been checked into). it took three calls and 15 minutes with me finally pressing the Operator to locate someone to help, (is there lack of adequate staffing even with the hotel being new?), the creamer in the room is powdered--not even mini moos, there is no option for very high speed internet, and no phone on the desk. The phone by the bed is remote, but no speaker ability on the handset, so to participate in web conferencing with two-way audio one needs to hold the handset.

“Westout”,"Where do I start? Guess the beginning. I arrived during the rain and the doormen finally got to me after about 2-3 minutes and asked if I was checking in. They told be they don't valet and that I had to find parking structure. They provided little to no help and when I asked the concierge, she pointed around the corner and didn't offer to help by calling. Thirty minutes later I returned after finding a place around the corner. Pt 2: The maids left a vacuum cleaner outside my room for a day--just ghetto. Pt 3: A maid knocked on my door and without waiting for a response, entered. I was shocked and reported to management. Lastly, this hotel was far from being ready to accommodate guess to the Westin standard. The staff ranged from very inexperienced to very experienced and other than the great gym, there were not amenities . I really paid much too much for what I got.

"“Great people, great hotel”","All around wonderful experience, things I LOVED about this hotel & my stay:
- Front desk staff was so kind, welcoming (Doris or Deloris, I think) and very excited about the renovations.
- Room was GORGEOUS with an incredible view of the Chrysler Building.
- Bed was fantastically comfortable. Usually hotel pillows deflate once you lay your head down, not these. Fluffy and firm.
- Room service was 24 hours and pretty delicious. I suspect they will broaden their menu once their restaurant opens. The Room Service staff was so sweet and friendly.
The best part of the hotel was the people: The general vibe was pure happiness and desire to express superb customer service (they did!). They all seemed really proud of the hotel and just pleased to be a part of it. You could feel their excitement & it made for a really awesome stay:)",Oct-12,93593,18,142360729,5,howardlover

Every employee was always in a hurry. The room was very comfortable with a not so nice view and dirty windows, was next to the elevator banks and you could hear the noise all night.

“Good location but has to raise it's game”,"We checked into the Westin Grand Central on the first day of its re-branded incarnation.
The check it was fast enough but we got to our rooms to find both key cards failed to open the door (not what you're hoping for after a 24 hour journey). This was quickly resolved though and we were compensated with free internet for the duration of our stay by the lovely lady on reception.
The rooms where fine, with standard amenities and a view of the Chrysler building from our room along 42nd St.
The rooms also have the bonus of having an iron and board in the cupboard.
The shower curtains are the wrong size for the bath though, so be prepared for a wet floor.
The entrance to the hotel does have a lot of building work at the moment and I presume the screened off area was being converted into a bar or restaurant. We couldn't hear the noise from our room on the 22nd floor though which was a bonus.
We checked out after six nights and again this wasn't straightforward as the billing system was down and the confused lady (not the same as the one that checked us in) went to get help and left us hanging at the desk. She came back after a few minutes and said as we're pre-paid we could leave without a check out.
Our folio was emailed to us later and the bill was correct.
Now, we chose the Westin at the last moment due to availability and price, around $500 including tax per night but there are better options in the area at the same price if you book ahead.

“Try somewhere else”,"I travel a lot and stay at a lot of hotels. I recently stayed at the Westin in Melbourne, Australia, and was so impressed that when I had a choice of hotels in New York I naturally choose the Westin. I believe there are two primary aspects that define a hotel experience. The first is the comfort of the room and the second, the service.
This hotel has only just re-opened and so the rooms are nice and fresh, tastefully decorated and quite cosy. The bed is comfortable, the curtains block-out, the aircon works well and the bathroom is a reasonable size. I never like showers over the bath and I like them even less when the drainage does not work effectively. I mean seriously in a newly renovated hotel I do not expect to end my shower standing in 2 inches of water. Other than the shower, which was a big disappointment, the room is comfortable.
The service however was the most disappoint aspect of this hotel. There are lot's of staff but they all seem to be busy with something other than their customers. There was more than one occasion I sought out assistance only to be handed off to someone else that was even less interested. I will come to New York again in another month, I will not stay at this hotel.",Oct-12,93593,35,142234787,2,wedmanSingapore
“Great location; Hotel will be great Business Hotel after renovations”,"Stayed at the Westin this week, on 10/3 ... just two days after the change over from Helmsley to Westin. I am very excited to have a new Starwood property in this neighborhood, as it is very convenient to my office, to Grand Central and to many of the major mid-town business restaurants. It will be very convenient.
The hotel is still under a lot of work, so be prepared for noise. The rooms have been updated and were very nice, although a bit small even by New York standards: perfect for business where you won't spend a lot of time in the room, but not really something I would book for a vacation or weekend get-away. I was a little disappointed to hear so much noise from the hallways at night, assuiming that updated noise control would have been a part of the renovation. It was not bad enough that I would not stay here again, but generally have me the feeling that I was not really in a very private location. (I found myself wispering on the phone as I had concern that people in the hallway and the rooms next door could hear every word of my conversation.)
Overall, as a business hotel in this neighborhood, it's a great choice. Much newer than the tired Grand Hyatt and with so much construction, I can only assume that great things are planned for this property. I only hope the build out a nice rooftop bar like the Grand Hyatt has, as their location makes for a perfect place for such a bar. (If they don't however, and you still choose to stay here, be sure to go to the Grand Hyatt rfooftaop bar, it's spectacular.)",Oct-12,93593,27,142222974,4,Bus_Travel_TX
“The Westin fit the Bill for our Needs”,"We stayed at the new Westin (formerly the Helmsley) for 5 days the end of Sept. We used our Starwood points and got the 5th night free which was a great deal. The location was great. The UN was in session (down the street) so there were police and secret service everywhere. It made it rather interesting. The lobby and entrance were in disarray due to the conversion to the Westin which happened during our stay. The important thing for us is the bed is very comfortable and I that there be a bathtub. The bathtub was small- a shower bathtub combo which you usually don't get in higher end hotels, but it was doable. There is a Starbucks down the street where my husband would go to bring back lattes which was nice. We love to walk everywhere so walking a few blocks to Grand Central was not a problem. We did not see the gym nor did we need any service, so I cant speak to those issues.

“Typical Westin - Location Not Great”,"Westin just remodeled this old Helmsley hotel so everything is fresh and it all works...but there's nothing special about it. Ear-splitting techo-pop greets you in the bland beige lobby upon check-in - maybe the Westin wants to be a hip, groovy W? The rooms are contemporary, neutral and masculine with the usual great beds and nice showers, although my husband commented that someone who doesn't shave must have designed the bathroom lighting. Wi-fi is $14.99/day. They do have coffeemakers. The mini-bar has a scolding message on top that if you open it to store your own food in the fridge, you'll be charged. Plastic cups and lack of newspapers are a turn-off in something at this price point, as is the location. ""Grand Central"" is a misnomer. The station is a hike across three long blocks and there's nothing much in the neighborhood unless you're doing business at Pfizer across the street. At least there's a nice coffee/breakfast takeaway place next door. We ended up taking a lot of taxis because the subway was such a hassle (and at other hotels, I like taking the subway). As of October 4th there was no restaurant or bar - this wouldn't be a problem but this is a neighborhood devoid of bars and eateries unless you hike down to Grand Central Station. The facade is also still under construction. I'm a Platinum Starwood Preferred Guest but do prefer Kimptons now because of the free wi-fi, rooms with personality and style, newspapers, free morning coffee and afternoon wine. Why do cheap places such as Comfort Suites give free breakfast, wi-fi, fridges and coffeemakers while the ""five-stars"" fail to meet their customer's needs?

The rooms have been upgraded to Westin standards; however, from the hotel front up to room door, there's not much to enjoy and the staff isn't making it better. I am a frequent SPG guest and I would pass on this property.",Oct-12,93593,1,142032797,2,Ron M
“Not Ready Now -- and Perhaps Not Ever”,"Just as the old Helmsley re-opened as a Westin, after renovation and re-branding, I have just stayed four nights, and will not do so again any time soon. The physical work is not yet completed, but the many short-comings are those of attitude and scope of service, which are not likely to be solved.
For starters, the ""Grand Central"" designation is a stretch, as is the haul with luggage the three long cross-town blocks from the address, between Second and Third Avenues.
Staff help was decent, including a very helpful concierge who arranged for some document printing.
But the overall attitude is cheap and cheesy -- including plastic cups in the bathroom, a pile of USA Today by the elevators instead of Times or Wall Street at the door, no service guide in the room, a key card dysfunction that forced me back down to the desk for a re-load, and one day when my room was not serviced at all.
Worse, from the perspective of a business traveler, is the annoying approach that everything is charged extra: $21 for a ""continental breakfast,"" when there are numerous Starbucks just around each corner; a ""business center"" that charges by the hour for computer access; $ 14.95 per day for WiFi; and a truly obnoxious mini-bar that would bill electronically if anything was even moved. 
In short, human touch has been sacrificed for a nickel-and-dime attitude.
The old joke about New York is that it would be a great city, ""if they ever finish it."" As for the Westin Grand Central, even if it gets finished, it will be far less than great.",Oct-12,93593,8,141998377,2,Jim P
"“Still in transition, but hoping for better next time”","I'm a big SPG fan and usually stay at the W Union Square when I come to NY. I stayed at the Westin to try it out as it's literally next door to my company's NY HQ. Unfortunately, it still needs a lot of work. While the staff was helpful and the rooms were comfortable enough, the adjacent plumbing sounds from showers and toilets flushing was unbearable. At midnight I was still dealing with a ton of ambient noise. Also, as a gold member, the room did not seem like an upgrade and I was told that what i was given was all they had. I know the hotel is still in transition and I will try it again in the hopes of having a better experience, but for now, I'm disappointed.",Oct-12,93593,5,141880913,3,Anne-Marie S
“Great hotel in excellent location”,"This hotel has just changed to the Westin from the Helmsley Hotel. It is very clean and the bedding and room is very comfortable. It is located close to many interesting sites. I left on October 1st which I believe was the day of their grand opening or change to the Westin. The scaffolding was removed from the front of the hotel and the opening appeared to be right on schedule. The hotel is within walking distance to Times Square, the UN, Grand Central Station and is very close to the subway. I have stayed in NYC many times and this is my favourite hotel and location.",Oct-12,93593,3,141878214,5,bigfootcanuck
“Outstanding”,"This hotel is superb an oasis in the middle of busy NYC. Spent 4 nights here with my partner for my 50th. Bedrooms excellent, like a country house, wooden floors, very comfy bed, great bathroom. It's not cheap but worth it for a treat. Locanda Verda restaurant was great if portions a bit small - they also cater for the hotel and breakfast was out of this world. Spa and swimming area superb. Bar & lounge superb and so relaxing you won't want to leave.
Only small criticism was staff are very young and someone ""old school"" is missing at reception. It's too casual for such a pricey hotel and they were unsure of location of recommendations around the corner. 
A very small gripe though - it's a great hotel.",Dec-12,1028569,1,146896742,5,honkytonklagoon
“stylish (and expensive!) hotel”,"After some indecision over this rating, I am giving this hotel 4 stars, even though it is outstanding in so many ways, because ultimately there are just enough issues that prevent me from conferring that 5th star. Chief among them,quite simply, is price; this is by far the most expensive hotel room I have ever taken in NYC - $700 a night before all the taxes - for a room that was smaller than what I get for several hundred dollars less at my usual hotel, and with a bathroom that doesn't compare by any measure. The bathroom was probably the most disappointing aspect of the room (and we did NOT take the lowest level of room - we had the Superior Greenwich room). 
But we wanted to stay in this part of town for this trip, and the Greenwich certainly seemed to promise the most charismatic and exclusive ambiance from among the choices. And on that score it definitely delivers - the public spaces are just gorgeous, and when it's cold they keep the fire roaring in the library all day. We didn't get to use the outdoor patio because of the cold, but in a warmer season, that is going to be a great place to start the day! And breakfast would definitely be more convenient and comfortable out there, as it is set up with actual tables and chairs. Instead, we had to take our breakfast in the library where you eat from the low sofa tables, which are perfect for drinks and snacks, but much more difficult and uncomfortable when having to eat with a fork and knife from a plate. But there is quite possibly no more lovely, inviting spot in New York to relax with a drink - it is beautifully and interestingly decorated, with subdued lighting and deep plush leather sofas that you can really sink into.....and that is precisely what makes it less comfortable, and even awkward, for eating breakfast. And there simply aren't enough spots available for having your breakfast on many mornings, and you'll have to wait for a place to free up. I think this is a serious issue that this hotel must address somehow. However, while you might wish you could be at a proper dining table while you eat it, you will not be disappointed with the breakfast as it is terrific, whatever you order. 
We found the rooms charmingly eclectic, but not exactly posh, if that is what you like. They had lots of extras, like plenty of interesting books, and of course all those free treats, which are fun and not your average mini-bar fare. (And they re-stock what you eat!) Our room on the 5th floor was really quiet, and no city noises intruded at all,even though we had a street-side room (as opposed to courtyard). It is just altogether a quieter part of town, particularly during the nights. We liked the hardwood floors, with the throw rugs scattered about, and the furnishings were inviting and comfortable. The fairly small bathroom - with only a shower and a single sink - in no way can be considered luxury. We are used to much more opulent bathrooms, particularly at this price point, but in other ways it is up to 5-star standards with plush and plentiful towels, bath robes, slippers, and great toiletries. The free wifi is something other hotels in the luxury category should be offering, and I commend the Greenwich on this.
We loved staying here, don't get me wrong; the hotel is full of character and incredibly elegant, and it excels at creating a boutique environment. However, when I think about what I could get for $700 a night elsewhere, I'm not sure I would stay here again. If you can afford the splurge, or can get a better deal than I was able to, you will love the atmosphere of the hotel, and if money is no object, then go for a higher category of room that comes with a soaking tub and more square footage.",Nov-12,1028569,11,146875310,4,Zorro_and_Gatinha
"“Great hotel, great location, great staff”","We stayed at this hotel for our first few nights in New York. On arriving at the hotel the reception staff were fabulous, they were welcoming, knowledgeable and went the extra mile without being asked. The room we stayed in was quite small, but decked out very nicely- the only way to describe The Greenwich would be funky bohemian. The little extras in the room stood out nicely-the complimentary non-alcoholic minibar, the different linen styles/colours each day. The bed was okay, the bathroom not brilliant-no exhaust system, no shower curtain/screen so water flowed into the bathroom every time we showered.
The best extra was when you place a wake up call, 10-15 minutes after the call is received coffee and tea is delivered to the room-loved it.
The biggest issue we had was no tea/coffee facilities in the room, this was apparent in all hotels we stayed at in the US-bit of a money grab I think.
Whilst we had a lovely stay, would we stay again-I don't know, and was it worth the money per might-I dont think so.
I would however recommend the hotel as it is worth a stay at.",Oct-12,1028569,16,146412724,4,weenjoyhotels
“Great library bar and a wonderful Japanese spa”,"I came here to have a massage after a friend highly recommended it to me. I liked the idea of a Japanese escape in TriBeCa, so I booked a ""Healing Birch"" massage to soothe a lingering back injury. The spa is underground, in a two-story complex that takes you away from the pace and noises of the city and into a Japanese relaxation haven. The decor is minimalistic, comprised mostly of wooden features. The bathroom is ultra-modern (they even have toilets with built-in bidets). There is a pool, showers, and steam rooms at your disposal, to use either before or after a treatment. 
I loved every moment of my massage. The masseuse used scented oils with aromatherapeutic and inflammation reducing properties. Heating packs were also applied to the sore areas de-contract muscles in order to have a deeper, and more effective massage. 
The one annoyance I had was that the hotel reserves certain spa services, and usually the more affordable/basic ones, to hotel guests only. 
While I was getting my massage underground, my husband brought a book to the hotel library bar. There was a wood-burning fire, antique rugs, and comfortable leather chairs and sofas. He ordered a single shot of bulleit, which the bartender generously poured (almost two shots). During his hour at the bar, he saw three a-list celebrities, and was treated as one of them by the very accommodating hotel staff. There is even an adjacent courtyard where smoking is permitted.",Nov-12,1028569,2,145681478,5,vsbarton
“Great service and atmosphere”,"We visited this hotel in November and were immediately pleased with service. The unique interiors were comfortable and the spa was excellent.

“The absolute best hotel”,"We stayed at the Greenwich last year just before the Christmas season and we are happily returning to do the same again.
It is a star studded hotel and yet very low key and elegant. It is, by far, my favorite hotel in the world. 
Robert Deniro has done a great job to make it feel comfortable and yet classy. The staff are very accommodating. The bedrooms are beauitiful with very comfortable beds and fun delicious stacks of old fashioned candy and snacks.

“Truly great hotel”,"We stayed recently at the Greenwich and had a wonderful relaxing 5 days. From the reception staff through to the Spa and pool , everybody was extremely helpfull. We've stayed in many 5Star hotels in both New York as well as internationally , however this hotel rates very highly.Situated in Tribecca it is handily placed for Soho/Ground Zero etc and surrounding areas so if you need to be in Times Square/Central Park etc, either travel by the nearby Subway or Taxi it.
Relaxation is prime at the Greenwich, so after a days shopping, sightseeing etc make sure you use the Pool and Spa.
Will definately return.",Oct-12,1028569,1,144728204,5,ray h
“Hurricane Home”,"I stayed at the Greenwich during Hurricane Sandy and on many levels all I can say is WOW.
I spend two weeks a month travelling and am fortunate to have stayed in some stunning hotels, what is unique about the Greenwich is the soul of the place and its staff, it is quiet, understated, cool yet entirely unpretentious we have all stayed in cool hotels where you go to be seen. The Greenwich is a cool hotel where you go to be yourself and relax with phenomenal staff and attention to detail. During the Storm the general manager was on hand at all times, friendly, calm and measured, the staff dealt with the situation with out losing a step. Eventually we lost power so the following day the hotel found me a hotel with power on 56th, I enjoyed my stay so much at the Greenwich I would have happily continued to stay without power. The rooms are good, the food is good but the staff and the management make this hotel exceptional. So please don't stay there as it is already difficult to get a room, but if you are lucky enough to stay, enjoy the best hotel in New York.",Oct-12,1028569,5,144610174,5,Jprholder
“I really like this hotel”,"This was my second time in the hotel.
En bref, everything that had to do with the hotel was great. What we had a problem with was the breakfast service from the restaurant.
Reception was very accomodating and efficient. They had no problems with us changing the reservation in the last minute to avoid Sandy
Guys at the door - great help with family luggage
Rooms are not only nice, and well designed, but cool and cozy. 
Also, no issue with family of four staying in a deluxe room (some other hotels would force you into two rooms, or a suite)
Bar at night is hapenning, and service is very good. 
My issue with the restaurant is that we have asked for some special dietary requirments for breakfast. It was not there, which apparently was fault of the reception. But the tone in which it was communicated to us by a waitress was condesending and unhelpful. Even my 8 year od daughter noticed tat. Then they mixed up the whole order, comign back twice with things we did not order. Butter was not brought in even after 3rd request. And I can go on and on...Now, I know restaurant is not part of the hotel, but it is a part of the hotel experience, and that even kids notice that people are rude and unhelpful really stands out.",Oct-12,1028569,13,144572802,4,Klanovice65
“Luxury and crisis management”,"This hotel lived up to expectations. If you stay in New York, you can spend your money two ways - on a non-descript luxury hotel in midtown (faux luxury that is designed to show wealth), or you can find a bespoke hotel like The Greenwich. The shared spaces, the rooms, the service, the attention to small detail, all suggest real thought and care about experience. You genuinely feel special when visiting. Not just because of cloying over-friendly service either. Rooms feel like individual apartments. Bathrooms are beautiful but have function inherent - deep baths, the most powerful shower ever! Complimentary snacks and soft drinks (no petty charges). Food from the restaurant available in the hotel, rather than separately. It was wonderful.
The hotel is amazing and what is more, they looked after us before, during and after Hurricane Sandy in Oct/Nov 2012. Sadly, when the power went out on lower Manhattan we had to leave, but the concierge staff organised a room for us uptown. 
A huge thank you to the staff who were brilliantly helpful, despite needing their own food, water and heat in this time of crisis. They showed us what good service really means.",Oct-12,1028569,1,144460185,5,Sam D
"“What a beautiful hotel. Gorgeous room, excellent service and beautiful amenities”","My Mum and I stayed here, as well as a couple of other high-end hotels and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. The decor is beautiful, the room itself was gorgeous and spacious, and the bathroom (and bath products) to die for. Breakfast in the stunning courtyard is something everyone should experience (even if you are not staying in the hotel). You can't believe you are in the middle of NYC. I can still taste the toast with ricotta and burnt orange jam! Staff are so lovely. Lots of great restaurants in the area (including next door) and a Whole Foods and giant Barnes & Noble just down the street. It is in a relatively quiet neighbourhood (Tribeca) ie lots of great restaurants, a park with a growers market on the weekend, but shopping district and closest subway a 10-15 minute walk away (the only slight negative, if you want to be in the thick of the action). But I really, really, loved this place",Aug-12,1028569,1,144426592,5,MooshkinSydney
“Utterly enchanting”,"Five nights and I am hooked. Relaxed and inviting, this hotel will charm and impress even the most seasoned traveller. We stayed in a deluxe king room and it was spacious, with a spectacular bathroom and deep soaker tub. Couldn't hear a peep from the neighbours thanks to the sound-proof construction. Meals in the lounge area were delicious (for breakfast do not hesitate - get the French toast!) The gym is well equipped, and the change room has a fabulous steam shower you must try. The spa is very relaxing and I enjoyed a massage by a very capable and attentive masseuse. The remarkably soft kimonos had me thinking I should wear one all the time. The restaurant at the hotel - Locanda Verde - is very good and extremely popular. Staff are friendly and discreet. I simply can't wait to go back - it honestly took me days to come down from what was an amazing experience.",Oct-12,1028569,6,144070492,5,Tamara W
“Perfect”,"If you can, this is the place to stay in New York (even as a treat to break up a longer stay). Spent 3 nights here at the end of 2 weeks, and what a glorious way to end our holiday. Everything is just right. Not glitzy, not snobby, just so comfortable and cool that it is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The pool is amazing (so calming) and the staff so attentive, friendly, and very interested that we were looked after just right. We stayed in a courtyard room (on a recommendation from someone else) and it was like we were in an italian city! The rooms are so quiet that we didn't hear anyone else (except in the hallway when late night revellers returned - but not once they were in their room). Loved the minibar treats (not your standard fare). Actually glad I hadn't read too many reviews or some of the other surprises would have then been expected and not exciting. Highly, highly recommend.",Oct-12,1028569,1,143809465,5,Sharon S
“Wedding Weekend”,"We spent three nights here over our wedding weekend. We live less then 30 miles from the city, but decided to stay in the city over the weekend. The staff was beyond helpful and nice. They had champagne waiting upon our arrival, accepted all of deliveries for the wedding. The spa was very relaxing. We did not use the pool, but it was great looking. The hotel bar and courtyard and tucke away and very private. The day we got married (NYC Courthouse), the hotel offered us the hotel car which was great. 
We also brought our dog (he is a very big Rhodesian Ridgeback) and every time we took him for a walk he was greeted with treats and open doors! 
The location is awesome. It is in TriBeCa and a short walk you have views of the Statue of Liberty, a long walking path and a great selection of places to eat and grab a drink.
The restaurant attached, Locanda Verde, is amazing. We had our wedding dinner there. 
This hotel is first class and is a true gem in the city.",Jun-12,1028569,9,143756607,5,Samantha P
“The Perfect New York Hotel!”,"Without doubt this is one of the best places to stay in New York. We stayed here for our honeymoon and the location is excellent. If the retailer Anthropologie did hotels this would be it. What a wonderful place!
The rooms here are spacious and beautifully decorated. The beds are very comfortable. The feather pillows were too soft for our liking and the hotel swapped them immediately for firm foam ones and they were much better. They then made a note so we were sure to have the same for our next visit. Rooms have a complimentary mini bar (alcohol not included) and a snack basket. A fantastic touch and very useful after a long day out and about, especially if you like Hershey's Peanut Butter Cups! The bathrooms are perfect and all the usual touches you would expect. Very large shower, water in all directions. Toiletries excellent. Beautiful handmade soaps.
In our opinion the hotel website doesn't quite do the hotel public areas justice. There is a private sitting room with bar for hotel guests only and here you can order inspired cocktails and delicious food from the adjoining restaurant whilst sat next to the crackling log fire. Free hotel wifi, fast connection. Beyond the private room is a wonderful courtyard garden where you can eat and drink alfresco. There is also a large public sitting area at the front of the hotel. All in all plenty of room to relax after a long day walking in Manhattan. The Robert De Niro art on the walls is a lovely touch. Good actor, hotelier, restaurateur AND artist!
The restaurant connected to the hotel, Locanda Verde (accessed through hotel or separate street entrance) is excellent and serves delicious Italian inspired food and drink. Warning: it gets very busy most of the time and booking a table is recommended. Breakfast here is also very good but as already described you can order from the menu in the private sitting room if you prefer. The hotel also has an excellent room service menu for ordering in your room or downstairs.
The spa in this hotel is truly magical and the swimming pool well worth a visit. The 250 year old structure that surrounds the pool is totally original and an inspired touch.
The service is outstanding, friendly and nothing is too much trouble.
Just one criticism: the bathrooms can be a bit noisy in next door rooms. For us it was not a problem as we rose very early due to jet lag. This is a very small problem and all in all the positives made this insignificant to us.
The rooms prices indicate the level of attention to detail and service. You will not be disappointed. Well worth a visit!",Oct-12,1028569,4,143146249,5,redeye488
“Glorious”,"Stayed here on the first night of our honeymoon, on our way out of the country. Absolute perfection - from the fabulous staff to the serene pool to the delightful basket of goodies, handwritten note and warm cookies awaiting us in our room.

“Sophisticated and Relaxed Boutique Hotel”,"We enjoyed the location of this hotel, with a very city feeling, yet fresh, sophisticated and upscale. The personel and service at the front desk during check in was very helpful in making dinner reservations and getting tickets for a Broadway show at the last minute on our last night on the East Coast. We liked our room with a bath, large and spacious, and especially the afternoon light in the bedroom. All the extra amenities were a surprise. The bar area was relaxed and comfortable, and a little dark for us. The Italian Restaurant had a stylish design and the food was delicious. The dining area with its bar seemed very popular. We asked for a table away from the bar, which was quieter and we enjoyed looking out the window at the city view. The staff at the entrance were very welcoming and helpful.

“Respite in the middle of busy city.”,Just stayed at Greenwich hotel for a 3 night girls weekend. We arrived early on a Thursday thinking we wouldn't be able to check in but luckily our rooms were ready. The smell of the hotel was heavenly and the 1st thought that came to mind was homey and cozy. The lounge and courtyard were beautiful. I liked our room but it was much smaller than what I expected and the bathroom was crazy small. I booked what I thought was a larger room (superior) but was disappointed. The bed was AMAZING! The towels on the other hand scratchy and stiff. My major complaint actually happened before I even arrived. I was corresponding with front desk regarding restaurant reservations and some room questions. Twice I never even received a response. When I did get to the hotel I had to ask for a breakdown of my reservations. When I arrived at one restaurant I was told that I did not have a reservation. Then I found out that my reservation for the next night was not made either. This was after I was told I was all set. That was the major thorn in my side. The food was delicious as were the drinks. The lounge helped create a very relaxed experience. Would I stay at Greenwich again? Absolutely; but I would be hesitant to trust front desk with important details.,Sep-12,1028569,77,141780256,4,josiewales
“NYC is amazing but will try another hotel next time.....”,"We stayed at the Greenwich Hotel for a 10 night break in NYC early September. This was our first visit to NYC (&USA) so we really wanted an extra special hotel to stay for a 10 night break. The reviews on TripAdvisor really made our minds up to book this hotel as they were so excellent. 
The room booked online was a Greenwich Room which we were very pleased with. Immaculate furnishings, nice cookies awaiting on arrival, fabulous bathroom & generally all was great. The room overlooked Greenwich Street & after 2 nights there we were struggling with the lack of sleep due to the dustbin/recycling wagon doing its nightly visit at 3.00am. There was also roadworks situated on the road adjacent to the hotel which commenced at 6.00am. 
We asked the reception if they would kindly consider changing our room to a quieter part of the hotel. We were given another room overlooking the Courtyard. This was a much smaller room & was quite dingy & dark due to no daylight getting into the room. No mention of a downgraded room had been made so we quickly returned back to reception to ask if it would be possible to have the same standard of room. The lady on reception was adamant that the new room given to us was indeed still a Greenwich Room. We checked the room descriptions on the Greenwich Hotel website & in no way was this a Greenwich Room, without a doubt it was a Courtyard Room. The dimensions, the furnishings etc, everything was the same as the Courtyard Room described on their website. The reception begged to differ & why on earth would be pay XXXX extra dollars for a room downgrade??? We asked to be returned to our previous room as they had no other rooms available for us. The reception asked if there was anything else they could do for us (?!) & kindly offered to give us earplugs!! (P.S. The earplugs never showed up) – was she taking the mick or what???
The roadworks continued & we are glad to be back home to get some sleep!
Overall the hotel was of a very high standard (after all J-Lo was staying there the same time – I wonder if they offered her earplugs??). The bar/lounge area is very comfortable (but very dark too – bring a torch), the bar service was pretty poor with no questions asked as to whether you would like another drink or if everything was ok. £40 for 2 glasses of wine too.
The biggest let down for us was the reception attitude & general lack of good customer service. After the hassle with the room change we really wished we could have booked somewhere else. The receptionists all seemed more bothered about posing behind the counter than looking after their guests. It felt like if you weren’t an official VIP then they really couldn’t be bothered with you. Such a shame as the location & the hotel in general was great. The spa area was nice but could have done without the life guard sitting in the corner reading his magazine throughout. Really not necessary!
I really must mentioned the guys on the door too – they were really nice & friendly & always ready to give you a smile & a hand with the door along with the luggage & taxi requirements – maybe the receptionist should take some tips from them!
The housekeeping staff were excellent too. I had asked for an extra pillow at reception & it never arrived (what a surprise!). I left a note in the room for the housekeeper to provide the pillow & it was there ready for me when I returned to the room in the evening. Great!",Sep-12,1028569,24,140402498,3,Louie1401

“Exquisite Experience”,"I was hesitant to commit to spending $500+ per night on a hotel. But I felt like a splurge, and decided that after reading so many positive things about this property, this would be my splurge.
It did not let me down. While the property doesn't necessarily create ""oohs and ahhs"" or ""wow factor"" from it's design, it doesn't try to. What it instead accomplishes is creating a mood that is both welcoming and accessible, but also exceedingly private and elite (with the snobbery and pretense).
The staff has a ""light touch"", which is to say always polite and friendly, but unobtrusive. They're there if you need or want something, and absolutely not there if you wish to be left alone. They're authentic, not cloying, and were able to resolve all needs quickly. It's a small thing, but they managed to pronounce my difficult last name correctly 100% of the time, something that simply never happens at lesser hotels.
The little extras are what really get you. The turn down service includes a bottle of spring water and slippers by the side of the bed, the remote control moved to your side of the bed, with the channel guide right underneath.
The free based of 15 goodies includes the most delicious pretzels and chocolate chip cookies, and free mini bar items of every variety.
The rooms are rustic modern; old-timey brass lamps that were not ordered out of a catalog to be purchased in the thousands like at any chain hotel. The bathroom doesn't overwhelm with modern gizmos; it's like a rustic farmhouse bathroom - but everything works!
The swimming pool and area and gym are second to none, and the largest I've ever seen in Manhattan. The spa, though very expensive, had a great authentic Japanese feel to it.
The restaurant was exceptional, and though service could be a bit more lethargic than ideal, it was adequate. The private drawing room and courtyard - both quite large an adorned with country house and private club type of accoutrement - were a definite positive to the vibe of the place.
And the location, TriBeCa, as my first time staying here after many trips to NYC, is now one of my favorite areas of the city. Charming and classic, close to everything, and with a great old neighborhood feel.
Worth the splurge, without question.",Sep-12,1028569,51,139250925,5,RobertGrunnah

The service was a real boutique hotel, very personal but informal !!! I love !!! All the doors men are very polite and helpful. The front desk people was unbelievable helpful too !!! Everything was so perfect... the room was enormeous and very cute! My only complain was the bed floor, was made with wood and very noise when walk through - and its ok if you will be alone in the room... but a problem if you share. 
I definitely recomend the Greenwich Hotel for everyone !!!",Aug-12,1028569,20,138414110,5,buinaba
“Perfect Quality/Price.”,"Location Location Location. In the heart of Tribeca.
Staff are very friendly and everything you need is there. Coming from Paris, I extremely enjoyed the European vibe present at the hotel. Great food ( delicious tartare with truffles!!) and cocktails in the cozy lounge at more than reasonable prices. Rooms are cozy rustic and best of all minibar is free! 
The spa / gym/ pool are all up to a 5 star standard.
I can't critisize anything in the hotel- I will always stay here when in NYC.
The attached restaurant open to the public is not as enjoyable since you end up with typical annoying new york city service.",Apr-12,1028569,1,137542123,5,Adel J
“Paradise in NYC”,Away from the frenzy of Midtown yet accessible to everything. Service and discretion is top notch. Beautiful rooms that make you feel at home.

“Home away from home”,"The Greenwich Hotel was recommended by a colleage, and it didn't disappoint. We loved everything about it; the rooms, the decor, the staff, the pool, the courtyard. We really felt at home, so nice to stay in a small friendly hotel.",Jul-12,1028569,5,136003862,5,Perth0990
“Worth the Risk”,"This is my first time staying at a five star boutique hotel and I strongly feel I made the right choice. If privacy is a priority, the Greenwich is definitely for you. 
First of, we are a young couple who are mid 20s and we didn't want anything like typical cliche 5 stars hotel with either horrible European royal decor or super boring modern interior. So, the Greenwich perfectly fits in our criteria.
The decor is a major success in what the Greenwich tries to achieve - the modern European&Moroccan twist. We absolutely love every single detail in the hotel. However, I have to say that our room lacks of the final touch in order to give the room a more personal ambiance. The room(Greenwich) was lovely but still feels a little stiff like everything has been left untouched for ages. Absolutely no major issues but we recommended the hotel to put some fresh flowers or perhaps a painting to reach that finishing touch. The bed was superb. The bathroom was decent with an extra deep bathtub. We especially love Red Flower Ocean products the hotel provide in the bathroom. We also enjoyed the free minibar and snack baskets (excluding the alcoholic beverages) which they fill up daily. 
The hotel lobby is brilliant but a bit too cold! The drawing room and the courtyard are stunning despite some unwanted insects in the outdoor area - we found some dead bugs on our chair but I guess it's hard to avoid! Nevertheless, having a breakfast in the courtyard was a bliss.
The food was very good. We have experienced quite many high end and Michelin star restaurants before and we particularly think Locanda Verde serves the best granola.
It was a shame that we didn't get to try the Shibui spa, but the pool was a certainly a highlight of our stay. It's extremely well decorated and private. Yet, we think some low key music would be great to break the silence because we - as a couple - have made other guests felt awkward in a pool area whenever we just casually talked or giggled. The pool bathrooms were fantastic with a combined steam sauna and shower. The changing area had everything you can possibly want, everything from hairdryers to razors, hairspray, mouthwash and even a Japanese style high-tech toilet! 
The location is excellent. Tribeca suits best according to the hotel concept. It's one of the loveliest and safest neighborhoods in town, surrounded by all the amazing cafes and restaurants. We were unsure at first if Tribeca is a bit too far off from the town but after spending time in the midtown for the whole day, coming back to Tribeca feels much like a reward.
The seniors staff was very helpful and impressive. The bellboys and maids are very well trained - quick and proficient, yet there was few maids that were not able to communicate in English very well which caused a little confusion when making requests, but they surely did a fantastic job in our room.
Last but not least, we are a little bit disappointed with the front desk. They were very efficient in their tasks and very friendly but lacked the professionalism one would expect from a 5 star hotel. 
The hotel seems keen on hiring young staff (part of their image perhaps?) and we think the addition of some more senior professionals would be great. They spent quite a bit of time talking to each other and joked around too much when they were not serving any guests. We understand if the hotel wants to create a young vibe but we don't think that the staffs at the front desk are at a level one would expect from this price. It was still very memorable experience staying at the Greenwich hotel. If you are looking for something different with a high level of standard, the Greenwich is the gem you have been looking for. It's less of a well oiled machine than the Ritz or the Plaza but it more than makes up for that with plenty of charm!",Jul-12,1028569,5,134296377,4,Warunthorn P
“the place to stay in NY”,"i have been to the greenwich a few times now,
and every time it has been a great experience,
this place is generous and friendly,
and with a Pool!!
the rooms are great, and the space is plenty,
the lobby and annex room are great to spend time in, and the area is just ideal, if you like to be downtown and close to soho.
the in hotel restaurant, Locanda Verde is probably one of the best restaurants in new york, and close by is Nobu...
there is nothing bad to mention about this place and all the praises are mentioned in the previous reviews.

“I'm glad I tried this hotel-I will return.”,"The Greenwich Hotel has old world charm even though it is a a new hotel- beautifully decorated with reclaimed flooring, tiles, furniture etc.
Original artwork in lobby by R. DeNiro.
Peaceful and quiet-no annoying techno music or loud bar scene. 
Breakfast in the private courtyard-a wonderful way to start the day.
Location is perfect for a walk along the Hudson River.
Well equipped work out room.
Staff was very attentive.
My only complaint...my husband and I like a firm bed, but this one was too hard.",Jun-12,1028569,2,133955562,5,Catherine G
"“WOW, if you have the chance to stay here do it”","Checked in for the weekend at this small Tribeca hotel owned by Robert DeNiro. Only 88 rooms. If you want more place to stay that is completely relaxing and calm, this is it. The overall nature of the hotel promotes calm and relaxed environment. This begins first with the location of the hotel in the river walk area of the hudson on the west side of NYC. A short cab ride to uptown and your in the middle of the chaos but jump back into the cab and leave hustle in the rear view. Walk a few blocks out the front door of the hotel and your at the new world trade freedom towers. The best part of the hotel location is that its more like a neighborhood rather then a city. Great area to walk around and see how the families live in the greatest city on earth. I have been to NYC many many times and this hotel is certainly one of the best! The decor is muted and has a world charm architecture. The lobby is cozy and relaxing with large overstuffed leather chairs. The bar and center court garden just off the bar is a perfect relief from a long day of exploring, work or travel. The rooms are understate luxury. All high end fixtures in the European bathroom and English sheets for the king bed. The view form our room was nothing to write about but with all the attention to details for the overall comfort of the guest, looking out the windows was the last thing we thought to do. If you stay here you will be impressed and comfortable as if staying in a friends spare room in the city.",Jun-12,1028569,4,133353588,5,Rick P

"“Trendy Area, Quiet Hotel in a Bustling City”","In the last 6 months, I've stayed at the Parker Meridien, W Times Square, and the Plaza Athenee and the Greenwich 2X. The Greenwich is by far my favorite. Room size is significant for NYC. Some of the rooms have hardwood instead of carpet.I prefer the wood. While the Westin claims to have a heavenly bed, the beds at the Greenwich are so comfy. As other reviewers have noted the courtyard is pretty and the private bar near the fireplace is fabulous for a glass of wine in the winter. The morning breakfast in the lobby bar in winter and courtyard in summer is also enjoyable. I ordered coffee from room service and felt like it was delivered before I hung up the phone. I used the Amex fine hotels both stays and did receive the upgrade. The work out facility is better than the Equinox at the Parker and the small gym at the Plaza. I had to cab it uptown for meetings but prefer the Tribeca, Soho location for restaurants and shopping. When you stay here you feel as if you are a New Yorker not a tourist. I love the stocked mini bar. If you are a woman traveling solo, this is a great place to stay.",Jun-12,1028569,102,132401687,5,onmyway
“The best boutique hotel in NYC”,"You pay for what you get.At Mr De Niro's Tribeca hotel you'll pay $750 for the right sort of rooom and the kind of hotle that goes with it. You want a room overlooking the courtyard that makes you feel you are in Italy when you are in the room and definitely in the best of NYC when you are in the hotel.If you are working mid town then of course the Greenwich seems like it could be a long way out of the way. But take the E train and you are on Park and 51st withinn 20 minutes of walking out the door. The front desk staff are seriously good, in fact except for the doormen all the staff are seriously good with no attitude.Eat breakfast in the courtyard in summer, eat at the bar at night if you are by yourself and have very big glasses of wine by the glass.Any hotel that starts off the guest breifing with we dont like paying $12 for a bag of peanuts and then goes on to say that except for alcohol everything in the mini bar is free has to just understand guests so well.After 40 years commuting to NYC this is the real deal",Jun-12,1028569,51,132138333,5,Connolly47

"“Nice hotel, but too shabby chic for me . . .”","I travel frequently to NYC for work, and have stayed at this hotel a few times in the past few years. My work colleague who travels even more frequently loves this place, and will not stay anywhere else. He finds it incredibly homey. I am not as much a fan. The style is cluttered -- overstuffed sofas that look ""lived in"" in the lobby, ""distressed"" wooden floors, chintz coverings. Sort of what you might find in a well-cared for English country house on PBS. I like minimalist design, and this is the opposite of that. In addition, there are times when the prices are upwards of $700 per night, which seems too crazy, even if it's on the company's dime. A few perks -- all snacks in the well-stocked mini-bar are free (which leads one to binge on tasty free chocolates), and there are full size shampoos, conditioners, moisturizer from trendy Red Flower in the bath. The Tribeca neighborhood is great -- lots of nice restaurants nearby.",Apr-12,1028569,154,131093423,4,Buben
“catering issues”,"I love this area of Tribeca as i used to live nearby in the 1990's. This quirky hotel has a suitably downtown vibe; all the rooms are different with the decor carefully designed to appear to have been thrown together with inherited furniture etc and the employees all seem to be 20 something chaps , all effortlessly neat,stylish and meaning well ( but not all that experienced in the tricky business of running a great hotel.) There is a great , dimly lit pool with a japanese feel in the spa. My main problem with this slightly expensive wondrousness is that it uses the next door restuarant , locanda verde for its catering and it doesnt open till 8 am which is useless for business travellers. The staff offer to get coffee/ food before then but they either forget whos responsibility it was to get it from the restaurant or the restaurant forgets etc. also, the lounge tables arent suitable for eating drippy poached eggs from ( they are knee height) and it all seems a bit of a bother for the staff. Overall then, a fine place to explore downtown from as long as you are not an early riser and as long as you realize that there is no catering that is owned by the hotel onsite.",May-12,1028569,9,130719012,3,Mark H
“Nice place to call home”,"It is really a fine hotel! It is a unique experience.

“Wonderful overnight stay”,"What a nice hotel. Great attention has been put into the decorating of this hotel and to the overall feel. We felt as though we were in Europe. The room was very nice and was very clean. I sat on the bed covers and walked around the room barefoot, something I am often reluctant to do in a hotel. I loved the shower. Our room faced the courtyard and was very quiet. Breakfast was wonderful. We ate in the courtyard. The staff was very courteous.

“One of the best hotels in NYC and truly amazing restaurant”,"I cannot fault this property. The hotel is an exquisite luxury boutique and my personal preferred style- elegant but a mix of rustic European with stunning hardwood floors/beamed ceilings, colorful furnishings.

“I could live in that room”,"And eat all my meals at Locanda Verde. Staff is extremely helpful (boxed up and sent a package for me) and warm. The room was beautiful, with lots of books and light and an excellent bed/sheets and pillows. The room is better than it looks on the website. Good bathroom and toiletries. And lots of candy on all surfaces. Not sure about that one. Good location not far from shopping or wandering around in Tribeca, Soho, Greenwich Village. Subway stop not far. The spa is beautiful. In addition to my favorite restaurant there are good cocktails, and there is a private ""drawing room"" and patio in which to relax or order your meals from Locanda Verde. Very quiet. No hallway noise, and even if there was, there is a second door to shut off the hallway. The windows shut out all street noise. This is my new hotel standard.",May-12,1028569,12,129506899,5,mrsmaxernst
“Outstanding”,I cannot 'rave' about this hotel enough! The moment you walk through the door you feel comfortable. The staff are extremely professional and are happy to help with anything. We ended up extending our stay and even though the hotel was booked out initially they did their best to find us a room. The hotel describes itself as feeling more like someone's 'home' and that is exactly how it feels! There is such a warmth about it. The courtyard is nothing short of utterly beautiful. The drawing room is completely relaxing- especially with the log fire. They have used the space in the rooms well - I initially thought the rooms would be small but they are surprisingly large! The restaurant Locanda Verde is very good and has a great buzz. I will be returning to NY and this is the place I will go to.,Apr-12,1028569,3,129426081,5,La Coron W
“Utterly fantastic!”,"This hotel is utterly outstanding. I've spent a lot of time in hotels in NYC and The Greenwich Hotel is now, without a doubt in my mind, the best. I'm pretty picky when it comes to hotels, but this one was almost flawless to me. It oozes charm, warmth, cleanliness, individuality, credibility and style, and most importantly provides in abundance; a sense of genuine care and respect for it's guests. It's not the cheapest hotel esp. if you want a slightly larger room, but you cannot help but feel you are paying for superb, maintained quality and complete attention to detail. 
From the moment I walked in and was greeted by the fantastic reception staff, then met the attentive and friendly bartenders to whom I chatted with during lunch at the bar in Locande Verde, I immediately knew I had made the right choice to book a room and looked forward to two great nights of comfort and relaxation at this truly beautiful hotel. The doormen in particular are so charming and friendly, in a down-to-earth manner and they do their job to perfection. 
The eye for detail at The Greenwich is wonderful. In the rooms the extensive free mini- bar (minus alcohol) and gratis large basket of candy and snacks are a great and welcome change to the norm; the bathrooms were luxurious, spotless and the quality and size of the excellent toiletries again were very welcomed and enjoyed. (Note: they even have a plastic zip lock bag for travellers to use for liquids in airports – the attention to detail here is really quite admirable). The beds were great and linen superb quality. My only gripe was the queen bed seemed pretty small and pillows a little on the thin side. But next time I will just book a king room and just request an extra pillow or two.
The private residents bar is another welcome feature and overall I would highly recommend this hotel. I look forward to returning to stay again.",Apr-12,1028569,7,129382916,5,Poulain2012
“Outstanding”,"What we loved about the Greenwich
1. Service is impeccable.
2. Anything from the adjacent Locanda Verde restaurant menu served in the drawing room or courtyard
3. Rooms are very comfortable, but individual, and a bit quirky with charachter. Feels homely.
4. The log fire in the drawing room
5. The courtyard (for warner days)
6. The location; great for the film festival, lots of good restaurants around, and walking distance to buzzing SoHo.
What could be better (not much)
1. Can be diffciult to find a seat in the drawing room at times
2. Gym opening time could be earlier (for jet lagged europeans...)",Apr-12,1028569,21,129028117,5,Azure55
“Different and Delightful”,"Just returned from Tribeca Film Festival events and staying at this hotel topped the whole experience off!!! Wasn't sure what to expect since we usually stay in mid-town (like others have written in their reviews) but wanted to be close to our events. Can't say enough about the ambiance of this hotel. From the moment you walk in through the unmarked, unassuming doors you are treated like a returning old friend! The professionalism from the front desk staff (not to mention they all looked like they had stepped out of a fashion magazine ad!) was beyond exceptional! I took advice from other reviews and was very specific about the room type and upon check in was thrilled at the selection! Quirky but great! I was also surprised at the quietness of our room/floor! Thought it might be a problem because of the beautiful wood floors throughout hall and room (less to absorb noise of course) BUT slept like a baby!!! Bed was uber-comfortable! 
Can't wait to stay here again...and again....and again!! Thanks to all that made our stay just...so memorable!!!",Apr-12,1028569,17,128552712,5,ANN S
“Loved this hotel!!!”,"Just stayed at this hotel and we absolutely loved it. We usually stay in mid-town but wanted to try a different neighborhood and I can't wait to stay here again. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The hotel is small and it feels very cozy. Our room was unique with hardwood floors and a gorgeous bathroom. Spa was absolutely beautiful, especially the pool area. Unfortunately they had to cancel my facial at the last minute b/c the facialist cut her hand but they gave me a complimentary facial to use whenever I want in the future. I guess it's lucky I live close-by.
It was my b-day and they left a bottle of bubbly in the room with a nice note... loved the vibe in the courtyard and the Library/Den off the lobby. Dinner in the courtyard from Locanda Verde was delicious and it is a nice perk to not have to stress about getting a reservation somewhere on the weekend. Honestly i can't say enough about how great this place was. I highly recommend it.",Apr-12,1028569,101,128450042,5,josiegrammer
“Incredible Hotel Experience”,"My wife and I are former Manhattanites who still work in the city, but now live in NJ. We recently came back to town for our anniversary and stayed at the Greenwich Hotel. We knew little about the hotel, but saw a high rating from one service and the hotel restaurant, Locanda Verde, is one of our favorite restaurants. 
We drove up to the hotel entrance and were met by a smiling valet who offered to take care of our car and our bags. I asked him whether we needed to take a ticket or receipt and he said ""no, just call down when you need the car"". Like any New Yorker, current or former, my first thought was that he was stealing the car, but with the uniform and good looks, we decided to give him the benefit of the doubt.
At the front desk, we were assisted by 3 young, good looking people. I just turned 50, so anyone born since 1980 seems young to me. Anyway, these ""kids"" told us we had been upgraded to a nicer corner room, #202. On the trip to the room, I noticed that the hallways were modern, the keys were techno-cool and the building materials looked unique in a way that positions the Greenwich Hotel as the antithesis to, say, a Hyatt, where consistency is applauded.
The room was well appointed and the mini bar was free except for the liquor. 
At the hotel, we got face and scalp massages as well as a couples detox bath which was incredible. The pool was great (when the kiddies left) and the gym looked fine, although we didn't have time to use it.
The biggest draw at this hotel is the food. Locanda Verde is the hotel restaurant as well as the provider of room service food. We had dinner at the restaurant which was fantastic, after-theatre dessert in our room which was great and Sunday breakfast in the courtyard off the drawing room which was very good. As a foodie, going 3 for 3 puts the Greenwich Hotel way above many of the more-well known high-end hotels in the City (we have stayed at most of them).
The staff is helpful and they seem to like their job. The price per room was reasonable for quality NYC and the hotel doesn't nickel and dime you by charging for wi-fi and bedside water. Overall, it was an incredible hotel experience we would recommend to family and friends.",Apr-12,1028569,2,128137456,5,mondial99
“Favorite Stay in NYC!”,"My absolute favorite downtown NYC hotel with an eclectic, yet understated vibe. Friendly, helpful staff who are polished and easy-going. A cozy gem I didn’t want to leave. Co-owned by Robert De Niro, draws a celeb crowd who can feel comfortably part of the scene. Each guest-house-like room is decorated differently; some more Asian-inspired, others have a rustic farmhouse feel. Spring through Fall la piece de resistance is their zen-charming interior landscaped courtyard garden for a bite, cocktails or to read the paper.

Both are terrific properties, the Crosby has better views but the Greenwich had a much cosier feel (that's not a reflection on the room size, my room was quite spacious) and ultimately more comfortable. I found the location great, but I used to live in Tribeca, so I'm biased towards the neighborhood. I was a huge fan of the drawing room with the fireplace, and I loved that you could get served there from the full Locanda menu. I'll definitely be back.",Mar-12,1028569,4,127752539,5,K J

"“Amazing weekend in New York, Greenwich top of the list!”","My partner and I spent a weekend in New York last November after becoming engaged the night before leaving. We had chosen this hotel as a ""splurge"" to celebrate. 
We booked the cheapest room, thinking that it would be good enough for us, and that we couldn't really afford an upgrade. When we arrived, our room was ready early, and when we saw our room, we were amazed! No upgrade needed! It was larger than we had thought, it was beautiful, cozy, thoughtful, and luxurious.
The whole hotel is AMAZING! Everything is beautiful, and the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The restaurant attached is really good! We ordered brunch from there and ate it in the drawing room.... it was the best experience, and the best brunch I think I've ever had.
The location is great. Very quiet and picturesque in Tribeca. The subway is close by and easily accessible.
We would definitely come back here. Although it's a little pricey, it's worth it. No nice hotel in NYC is cheap, and so for a little more, you'll be happy you did it.",Nov-11,1028569,4,125766376,5,caringtraveller78

When I was there Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes were in residence and there were paparazzi outside the whole time. It added a bit to the glamour especially when I walked past them one time. Just disappointing to realise that the flash bulbs weren't lighting up for me! :)

“Perfect stay in Tribeca”,"I am marking this review under Business, because the nature of my trip was business. But I would love to come here as a couple. The hotel was magnificent. One reads on trip advisor often where a reviewer will say it feels like home. Greenwich really does a great job of making you feel at home. The rooms are amazing. Not large, but beautiful and each room has its own custom designed bathroom. A shabby chic feel within the rooms. The drawing room is so cozy for a pre or post dinner drink. The staff instantly learns either your name or recognizes you to open the door for guests only. One must make time to enjoy the pool located in the basement. It is very hip and unique with its japanese farmhouse look. The restaurant in the greenwich, LOCANDA VERDE, is also a must while staying in new york. Great food three times a day. I really enjoyed my brunch there. Life just feels good when staying at the Greenwich. Everything is taken care of. Impeccable service. Beautiful style. So cozy.",Mar-11,1028569,4,124230641,5,Cugiemon
“Very trendy....and very expensive”,"My husband and I stayed at the Greenwich Hotel on a recent trip to New York - the hotel was chosen mostly for its location. Ok, and the fact it is owned by Robert de Niro. Fairly unassuming from the outside, the hotel has a wonderful ambiance inside - the eclectic decor combines African, Asian and European influences, includes some of De Niro's own paintings (who new he painted?) and the overall feel is one of cosy and warm - useful, given that during our visit the temperatures dropped below freezing (and probably the only time is will be this cold in New York this winter!). The hotel has an amazing lounge area where you can eat all your meals, or linger over coffee in front of the fire. The adjacent restaurant served excellent breakfasts, and the service was perfect. The resident pastry chef is a genius, and is clearly a major drawcard for the very fashionable New York set that eat at the restaurant. 
Our room was right at the bottom end of the price scale, and it was still reasonably expensive, given that it was small. Although the hotel is aiming for a more intimate appeal, and therefore each room is apparently different, I did feel that for our particular room they may have run out of the good furniture - my bedside table was a black steel thing that could have come from Walmart. The TV had very limited channels - I expected more from a hotel of this calibre - and the remote control was temperamental at best, which meant that to get to a preferred channel, I had to surf through all the previous ones to get to it. The TV listing guide also bore no resemblance to channels as they appeared on TV. We had some difficulties with the electronic room keys, being locked out on three occasions when the keys stopped working.
The bathroom was lovely - and the shower superb, as were the ample and fragrant toiletries. 
A big bonus was that all the in-room snacks and drinks (except for the alcoholic beverages) were free - and abundant. 
My complaints are minor really - however, given that this is not a cheap a hotel, I think that these small issues should be attended to.",Jan-12,1028569,6,124116065,4,Amanda V
“The most eclectic unique hotel in the city”,"Selecting a hotel in NYC can be a true quest. The options are endless. So where do you start? How do you pick your temporary pied-à-terre? Well, look at the immense possibilities as an advantage and choose a hotel that reflects your personality. That is exactly how we chose The Greenwich Hotel in Tribeca. 
How can I describe this masterpiece in one sentence? Simply impossible because this eclectic haven is so close to perfection. So only an elaborate appraisal will do The Greenwich Hotel justice. Let me guide you through our exquisite trip and it starts at the latent but grand entrance. From the moment you enter the Greenwich it is like walking through a gate to another world. A vintage world where time stood still. The antique mood makes you feel calm, relaxed and safe. You just want to get lost in this ancient villa. But actually this is not completely possible because the elevators will only give you access to your floor and the spa.
After a brief walk through the corridors you step into your room via a heavy hardwood door. It is like opening a vault and let me warn you: you will find a treasure. My eclectic genes went ballistic after seeing this dreamily decorated chamber. Don’t you love it when a collection of perfect single details becomes one? It is as if the Greenwich is forcing you to enjoy those little delights in life. The basket filled with sweet goodies and the champage emphasize that policy.
But there was one more secret waiting for me: the Drawing Room. My words will never capture the ambience of the private room, but I will give it a try. Imagine old vintage oversized sofas, small assorted side tables, exotic carpets, rich velvet drapes and a majestic fireplace. You absolutely know that the world outside is still spinning. But when you are in the Drawing Room, you don't care. You just want to enjoy the impeccable food of Locanda Verde, a glass of champagne or just a cappuccino. It is up to you. 
All in all The Greenwich hotel is an absolute match for my eclectic personality in every single way. Is there any other hotel in nyc like the Greenwich, I don't think so! This unique place is a true gem, one that you will have to cherish.",Dec-11,1028569,5,123609773,5,Knickerbockerforlife
“beautiful hotel”,"Greenwich Hotel is a beautiful hotel in Soho NYC. Staff were lovely and friendly particularly doormen and the staff in the lounge bar which had great service and a lovely roaring fire. Amenities included a wonderful pool which feels spa like and calming in a very relaxing atmosphere. The whole of the Greenwich is a relaxing place to stay particularly compared to uptown hotels and feels very discreet. The only comment I would make is that if you don't know Manhattan very well you may find the location not entirely suitable but we chose it as we know the city quite well and wanted to stay in Soho this trip and we found it a perfect stay. We booked a deluxe room and as this was for 5 nights we thought that we would have a bath included and although the shower is amazing a tip would be to request a bath if thats important to you as not all deluxe rooms have them and if we went for a return stay which we would definitely like to do, we would really like to have a bath included, although we were advised that we could move to a room with bath for the last two nights but we didn't want the inconvenience. The bed is extremely comfortable and we experienced very low noise levels An added nice touch in the room is that soft drinks and snacks are included. We now consdier the Greenwich our favourite hotel in New York and we have stayed in quite a few, admitedly its not a cheap hotel but but you definitely get value for money.",Jan-12,1028569,3,123519276,5,Helena B
“Great Get Away!”,"This hotel was perfect in so many ways. The staff was excellent and very helpful. Our room was incredible! The bed and shower were so comfortable and relaxing. All of the little details made this hotel seem very cozy and a wonderful place to stay. Lastly, if you get a chance you have to try the pool it is amazing! I would definitely go back to this hotel if I was to visit NY again.",Oct-11,1028569,3,123365268,5,CC04

“Great Concept”,"We booked a deluxe room for 2 nights through Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts. It was pricey -$700 a night. The room was gorgeous though (Room 312), full of character with beautiful linens, interesting rugs, and a great couch. We had a street view and had no noise issues. We slept great! The free soft drinks, juice, candy, etc. is a great touch. The bathroom was large and very elegant with white marble (no tub though). The private guests only lobby was a real treat. The fire was always roaring and the service in there was fantastic. All in all a great stay!",Jan-12,1028569,90,122838918,5,NVRam123
“awesome”,"my husband and i have stayed all over nyc in some of the nicest hotels around (the pierre, the ritz --battery park and cp, trump, the new york palace etc). Over the past few years we have migrated to lower manhattan as our preferred base; however, until recently, options there were somewhat limited. The Greenwich has been around for awhile but the price always turned me off a little--big money for a kind of small room. Well, I'm here to say, I was wrong. The Greenwich is awesome, our room was great, very unique and homey feeling (fabulous bathroom) and they include a lot things in the price that tend to make me feel nickled and dimed at other hotels. For example, wi-fi, instead of paying 15-20/day, it's included. That's $40-60 right there on a weekend stay. The mini-bar--stocked with great stuff and also included. We're big mini bar people so that's a $50 savings right there for us. House car to drive you around--included if it's available. If you can afford this place, I would definitely stay here. And if you have an amex platinum, they are now part of the program so you get a lot of bang for your buck. We were double upgraded and got a $100 spa certificate, which, unfortunately, I didn't have to time to us (crazy, right?). We've stayed at Trump Soho twice, which is very nice, but this place has a special feel that will keep us coming back. One final note, we are maniacs about noise, particularly hallway noise. The room we stayed in had a door to the hallway, a foyer, and then another door to the bedroom--excellent for keeping out the hallway noise.",Dec-11,1028569,43,122774346,5,dicooley
“Charming and cosy”,"A very nice small hotel in Tribeca, with lots of charm and personality. Free snacks and soft drinks, lovely courtyard and a very cosy bar.

“The best hotel in NYC”,"Stayed with my girlfriend at the Greenwich Hotel between Christmas and New Years Day - and having stayed in various hotels up town including various W's, KImptons, Intercontinentals - I have to say without doubt this is my favourite hotel in NYC. Everything about the hotel works from the quality of the the rooms to the superb service. Its more like staying in a private club than a hotel. The beds are amazing - and I honestly think I had the best nights sleep ever - beyond comfortable, the finest sheets, tons of pillows, and a mattress you want to go out and buy immediately. The hotel is very zen -but so comforting. I think what we really liked was the getaway from the hustle and bustle of uptown, to the quietness of Tribecca at night, and once inside the hotel apart from the public area you really don't see anyone, and never heard the rooms next door or above, or a single door closing. The rooms aren't huge, (but its NYC but more generous than most - and so quiet) but they are lit with variable light levels, and every rooms seems individual. Sofa in the room, bookshelves stacked with interesting books, a fridge and snacks that they don't charge you for (apart from alcoholic beverages), free wifi throughout the hotel, I dock and speaker, great TV's, and the most powerful power showers and superb bathrooms. Never known a bath tub to fill so quickly. The downstairs bar (for guests only - another really nice touch), is again very comforting with a large open fire place and Christmas tree (when we visited)- and you can also eat there with the full menu from the restaurant Loccanda Verdi. Prices are reasonable. In the Summer they have an open courtyard - again which escapes the noises of NYC. My girlfriend thought the spa area and pool were great, and the have a first class restaurant attached Locanda Verdi. If anyone had any complaint, it maybe that during the day it can take 30 mins or so to get uptown by cab, or coming back downtown from Central Park, however on a Sunday took just over 10 mins. (It's worth the journey to escape back to the tranquil surroundings and within the hotel). Metro also very close. Having always been attracted to the up town shops on 5th Avenue etc, we discovered the areas around Tribeca are so cool, great boutique shops, first class restaurants, Wholefoods!, and the areas of Soho and the West Village are so close. Have stayed at alot of first class hotels, and what we truly liked about the Greenwich is that it's not hiding behind a massive lobby entrance with the name plastered all over it, so it survives on reputation, and so it deserves too, this is the best address to stay at in NYC in our humble opinion. Few hotels get 10/10 but the Greenwich does without question. Can't wait to return.",Dec-11,1028569,9,122420011,5,CalsamLondon
“Favorite hotel in New York City - Charming!”,"This is my favorite hotel in NYC. I love the cozy atmosphere and all the nice touches. Had a deluxe king room with a balcony and it felt like I was somewhere in europe. Love the big wood doors and the charming decor. I'm not sure all of the rooms are like this but ours had a sign saying everything (except alcohol) in the minibar was free because nobody should pay $9 for a bag of chips! They had the most delicious oatmeal cookie sandwiches waiting for us at arrival. I love touches like that. The staff was friendly and Locanda Verde next door has great food and is where they get their room service from. Beds are extremely comfortable as well. Really enjoyed my stay!
Went another time and the spa was amazing. They have a heated swimming pool in a cool, cozy lounge area. Wish I had my bathing suit!",Jul-11,1028569,4,122359484,5,MelisaSingh
"“If you have no reason to be near Central Park or Times Square, come to the Greenwich Hotel!”","We chose this hotel for our late December stay in Manhattan... Couldn't have picked a better one! The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and the doormen give you a sense of belonging there... The courtyard room, albeit on the small side, is all you need for a couple of days in New York, and it comes with a sparse yet stunning bathroom (separate bath and shower)... On a rainy day, try the bar -- have some cocktails, ask for the cookies and be prepared to skip lunch or dinner! As for the usual nitpicking, we thought it was a tad bit cold in the (beautiful) pool area, and the 25°C / 77°F water temperature was definitely on the chilly side... Other than that, a gem!",Dec-11,1028569,18,122236745,5,jurgical
“A Fabulous Experience!”,"We stayed at the Greenwich over Christmas and loved it! We've been to NYC a few times and fancied staying somewhere other than midtown. Especially over Christmas, as we wanted to be somewhere with a chilled and relaxed atmosphere - the hotel was exactly that - everyone was so lovely, friendly and made you feel you were in a special private club rather than a hotel. We also thought TriBeCa was great - lots of great restaurants and bars, all within a few minutes walk of the hotel. When we did venture uptown we were so relieved to return to the oasis which was the Greenwich and TriBeCa. We would definitely recommend this as an excellent place to stay!",Dec-11,1028569,23,122185399,5,WarwickshirelittleL

“Can't imagine staying anywhere else now...”,"My wife and I recently celebrated our anniversary at the Greenwich. We booked a Courtyard room and mentioned the reason for our trip during booking. Upon check-in we were pleasantly surprised with a room upgrade to a Greenwich courtyard room, as well as a complimentary bottle of champagne. What a pleasant surprise!
The hotel is a rare oasis in the city. The building itself is a work of art as its interiors showcase excellent craftsmanship, design and and a thoughtfully curated selection of objects, art and furniture. From the moment you are greeted as you enter, shown to your room and settle in, you know you are in a special place.
During our stay, we had the opportunity to eat at the hotel's restaurant, Locanda Verde, spend an afternoon at the Shibui Spa, and eat breakfast and dessert in the drawing room by the fireplace, as well as enjoy the comforts of our room (as others have mentioned, the in room complimentary mini-bar and toiletries are outstanding). Throughout our stay we were not disappointed in any way.
In summary, there are other places uptown that have been around longer or might impress your friends more by their name recognition. But do yourself a favor - let them keep staying there, and keep The Greenwich as our little secret. It's that good.",Dec-11,1028569,23,121597870,5,drop_the_zero
“As homely as a hotel can be”,"We recently enjoyed a weeklong stay at the Greenwich for my wifes' birthday. As many of the reviews have said, this is a relaxing, homely hotel; which feels in some ways more like you're staying with friends rather than in a hotel. We thought the location was good, and also liked TriBeCa, feeling that the hotel mirrors the area in that it's a more relaxed, easy paced location when compared to other more frenetic areas in the city. 
Our 'Deluxe Greenwich' room (405) was comfortable and large enough; and noise wasn't a problem, despite overlooking Greenwich St. The room had all the amenities we could ask for, and lots of nice little touches, like the bowl of goodies that kept magically getting refilled every evening, and which provided constant temptation for my sweet tooth...
The spa was fantastic. The underground pool inside the 300 year old Japanese barn immediately transports you to Asia, and was a great place to relax. My wife had a few treatments too, and loved them. Plus the gym was very well equipped.
The guest lounge was a favourite of ours, perhaps a bit dark, but it had the feeling of a private members club with none of the formality or pretentiousness. We ordered from the menu of Locanda Verde (the excellent adjoining restaurant) one night and ate in the lounge, and on other nights we just stopped by for a glass of wine, or a nightcap. On one occasion there was a lack of seating, but were not surprised as it's popular with guests.
The staff throughout the hotel were friendly and efficient, and we got the impression that no request is too much; although we think we're not very demanding people and so didn't really test this. They are obviously very well trained and are very friendly if you speak to them, but if you don't then they will almost act as though they're invisible.
We did however have a couple of gripes. Firstly there didn't seem to be a concierge, so we asked the front desk staff for some local recommendations on a few separate occasions; local restaurants, bars, that type of thing, and their recommendations didn't really come up to scratch. Sending us to a below average, mostly empty, pizza place one night; and a bar that was closed on another. We got the impression that maybe they didn't often get asked for this type of advice, and so just said places they were aware of, rather than places they'd actually been to. But that was only a small thing.
Our bigger problem was that one evening on returning to the hotel, the atmosphere had changed completely. The hotel seemed to be on security lockdown. Instead of the warm welcome we'd normally received from the hotel porters; we were immediately challenged as to whether we were guests by someone who worked for the hotel who we had never seen before. One of the porters recognised us, and we were allowed in. So we went to the lounge for a nightcap, and on sitting down were again challenged by the same member of staff as to whether we were guests - this was 2 minutes later, so he must have had a very short memory. Anyway the service in the lounge was very poor that night, we were largely ignored, whilst the staff gathered in groups and shared huddled whispers with each other. It was clear they were on edge, and when we did eventually grab the attention of the staff to get served and enquired as to what was going on, we were told that they had a 'distinguished guest' in that evening. We were made to feel that despite being paying guests of the hotel (and lets not forget this is not a cheap hotel), that we were not as important as whoever this 'distinguished guest' was. What was supposed to be a relaxing drink, was anything but. So we went to our room, and vowed that should things not be back to a more normal state the following day that we would look to move to a different hotel. Thankfully the next morning normality had been restored. 
What we don't understand is that during our stay, we ran into a few instantly recognisable celebrities who were also guests at the hotel, and yet they didn't get different or special treatment from the staff. So what made that evening so different? Thankfully none of that really spoiled our stay; I only mention it because we got to see the hotel at its best during our stay, but had we only stayed that one night then I'm certain I'd be writing an entirely different review.
We will happily go back next time we're in New York. We just hope there are no 'distinguished guests' there at the same time!",Nov-11,1028569,57,121451678,5,Stones7
“Great Relaxing Hotel”,"Recently stayed at the Greenwich Hotel in November. Wanted to experience a smaller hotel in the Tribeca area. The staff was friendly, hotel was very homey and not flooded with people in the parlor areas. Nicely reserved for the guests who are paying. Our room was spacious, neat, clean. It is a 15 minute cab ride from mid town which is the drawback but depends on what you want to do. Would definately stay again. The spa was very nice as well, swimming and work out facility.",Nov-11,1028569,1,120952099,5,luv2cook64
“I'm in love with this place!! I want to move in.”,"So we spent 2 nights at the Gansevoort Hotel Park Ave and then came over to the Greenwich for 1 night on a ""Fine Hotels"" Package from the American Express Platinum card. The 2 hotels cost the same and you just get so much more at the Greenwich Hotel. My husband and I are in our 30s, travel a ton, and live in LA. I'm usually all for the trendy, modern hotels and so when I saw photos of this place online, I wasn't quite sure it it was our style or even catered to our age group, but I am SO glad we checked it out.
When you walk in, it feels like a warm, cozy home and not a hotel. The common areas are a great place to chill, have a glass of wine, meet with friends, or do some work on your laptop. The staff are very professional, helpful, and personable. 5 star service all the way. Pet-friendly too!! I saw some very cute doggies (and a cute celebrity) while we were visiting.
We stayed in Room 403....request it. It's lovely! It has a large beautifully tiled bathroom with a super powerful rain shower and separate deep soaking tub...(the lighting isn't great in the bathroom and quite frankly, the wall could use a new coat of paint even though they are going for a vintage-y look, but really that's the only negatives). The room itself isn't huge, but set-up perfectly with a serene little balcony overlooking the hotel's back garden patio. The free soft drinks, basket of snacks, and delicious cookies left out for us upon check-in just added icing on the cake to this very special gem of a hotel.
The pool and gym area are in the basement of the hotel, but they have managed to make it feel like the most peaceful, secret hideaway in the city. The spa services are great too....I had an amazing massage and highly recommend it.
The location is good...it's about a 5-10 minute walk to a couple different subway lines and about a mile walk to the West Village area. The area feels calm and neighborhoody with lots of restaurants and cafes just up the street.
Ahhh, I just wish we would've stayed here longer. I have not stayed at other boutique hotels in the area such as Crosby Street or the Mercer so I can't compare, but I will say I'm in love and want to move in. Nice job Mr De Niro!!",Nov-11,1028569,101,120642081,5,Teresa567

It is a true oasis away from the canstant bussle of New York, and ok it is not cheap, but a hotel of this kind is worth the splurge. The only (very minor) niggle I had, was the cross trainer in the gym was geared for long legged people, and as a short legged Scot, it proved an impossible work out (thought shared by an equeally short legged Scandinavian on the day)!

“Life Is Good At The Greenwich Hotel”,"My recent (Aug. 2011) stay at the Greenwich Hotel in Tribeca area was perfect! It had all the amentities of a 6 star hotel but much cozier! The bed was extremely comfortable (a must for my hubbie and I) with high end luxurious bedding, 6 different style pillows to choose from and very very clean and crisp! A welcome basket full of free yummies that satisfied the health nut and the sugar freak! Lots and lots of free drinks and bottled water! High end hair products and face lotions too! And the homemade cookies that they leave for you are to die for....no really! We fought over them! They brought more when we requested more. The air conditioning was quiet and very adjustable. Not the floor kind but real air conditioning! Our room faced the entrance to the street upstairs but was not noisey in the least bit! We watched as the paparatzzi snapped pictures of the influx of celebrities that happen to be staying in the more elaborate rooms at the Greenwich. We met Cameron Diaz, Usher and caught a glimpse of the Olson Twins. We never saw Seal and Heidi and the kids but they were staying there (I overheard the staff talking about it). The breakfast out in the garden was awesome! Their frittatta is so delicious I had it two mornings in a row! Oh yes and the shower was unbelieveable! My husband loved it! He said it was the best shower he had ever taken! We didn't work out at the gym even though it looked wonderful we did however take a late night dip in the underground pool! How romantic!!! I recommend this boutique hotel to lovers, families, singles and just about anyone who wants luxury but at an affordable expense. It's not far from everything in NY that anyone could possible want to see or do. Forget those expensive cookie cutter hotels...yuke! Treat yourself to the Greenwich Hotel and I'll just say ""you're welcome"" now.",Aug-11,1028569,4,119459575,5,sparky007
“Wonderful Staycation!”,"We lived in Tribeca for 12 years. We now live on the Upper East Side. This weekend my husband took my oldest son out of town to a football game. My six year old and I decided to take a vacation downtown to our old neighborhood and booked a night at the Greenwich. We had the best time. 
I feel totally refreshed and felt like I have visited another place and time without getting on a plane. Lovely greeting by staff who had called before hand asking if we needed anything. They booked us an early reservation at Locande Verde a hard place to get a table for dinner. We also had as requested non-down pillows in our bed due to my child's allergy and they were in place at arrival. The room was lovely. Simple and light. Nice books on the shelves. Bathroom was superb. Big tub and great waterpressure. Room seems simple yet everything is discreetly electronically controlled from the lights to the curtains. Linens were Bellismo. Ample towels. Red Flower toiletries. Even hallways of the hotel were nice smelling and pleasant. Very good sound control for a New York hotel. 
The common rooms are beautiful. Staff and guests seemed to be having a wonderful time. The drawing room is well done and you can get meals there as well. Courtyard was nice but it was a bit chilly to sit our there this weekend. 
What puts this hotels on the top of my list was the pool. It is very chic and well attended. My son loved our night swim after dinner and we spent another hour in there today. 
Staff is really great too. They all seemed like normal and engaged people. The hotel achieves that rare combination of informality with a high quality surrounding and service that puts one at ease. 
Next time I am coming with my husband. Reminds me of what Lodge at Koele achieved so long ago or even the Lanesborough. You just feel that you are in a very, very special and well thought out establishment",Oct-11,1028569,36,119368963,5,rdkflk

The shower is the best I have ever experienced. The gym is well stocked and open very early in the morning to accomodate most schedules. The products used throughout the hotel create a seamless experience. I would recommend this hotel to business travelers as well as family.,Sep-11,1028569,0,119291755,5,Mercuryaussies
“Worth staying just for the bath!”,"Lovely boutique hotel in Tribeca. Perfect if you feel like a change from more corporate hotels.
Great reception on arrival and personal tour of the room. Excellent basket of free goodies, many of the more American of which made it home to the kids. They loved the Orios.
Room was compact but lovely, bathroom was spectacular. The deepest bath I've ever seen and it filled in 60 seconds.
Make sure you eat or drink in the outside courtyard. Dark & atmospheric and the food is the same as the very popular restaurant. The service in the bar, restaurant and front room was immaculate; helpful with being obsequious. And the drink prices don't take the p%ss!
Great location for exploring downtown will be even better when all the roadworks are over.
Overall couldn't have had a better weekend in NY.",Oct-11,1028569,2,119113598,5,Weegieexpat
“Less than I expected”,"I'd stayed here twice before but this trip was disapppointing.
I was paying alot of money & did not like the room I was shown. At $ 750 per night I did not like the lip service that I was given which was that the room would be reviewed the following day by the Manager. It was not !
The hotel has a great location, is very under stated but proper customer service is vital in this industry.",Oct-11,1028569,37,119102674,3,Condor1950
“Another lovely weekend at the Greenwich”,This is the second time we have stayed at the Greenwich and we really enjoy staying here. The rooms are lovely and large and the decoration is great. They have a beautiful courtyard where you can have a drink on a warm day and their restaurant is very good. We have stayed in New York many times but would rather stay here than anywhere else as it feels small and homely. Last time we stayed we moved from a hotel uptown and requested a room with a tub the front desk didn't tell us that they couldn't accommodate this until we got there which was fairly annoying as it was only 24hrs in advance so I can't believe they didn't know what room would be available. Anyway still a great hotel and I plan to book way in advance next time I go to NYC to get one of the larger rooms with the deep soaking tubs. Divine.,Sep-11,1028569,14,119096680,5,LondonMGRG
“The best hotel in New York”,"I didn't really want to write this review because I've just booked my second stay at the Greenwich and they are already so booked up that I don't want to encourage anyone else to be staying there! 
I've stayed at all the big NYC hotels and just none of them compare to the Greenwich in my eyes. I adore the location of the place, the decor is just so individual and fantastic. The beds are so comfortable that we rang them to ask where they were from when we were redecorating our house. We were told the mattresses were from Duxiana but the actual bed frames were all bought individually at auction - and I can believe it. That pretty much sums up why I love the place.
When I was last there, the pool was out of order. When I complained about this they offered me a free night in the hotel - true customer service. 
I could go on and on....but just stay there...and make sure you get a room with a bath. Amazing! Oh and go to the restaurant as well. Brill. We saw loads of celebs at the hotel during our 5 night stay including Mr. De Niro himself which was a definite bonus!",Apr-11,1028569,58,118359142,5,thehappyone
“Weekend away”,We had a weekend away from our three kids and made an excellent choice with The Greenwich Hotel. We were so impressed with the service and how they seemed to think of everything. We loved the candy basket and fresh cookies as we arrived in the room. Also the personal tour up to the room was a very nice touch. The hotel has a very cool vibe as it makes you feel at home. We enjoyed the courtyard for drinks and dessert in the evening ( you must try the gelato sundae!). We travel quite a bit and are fortunate to stay in nice places throughout the U.S. I can confidently say that The Greenwich Hotel ranks on the top of the list. The only drawback would be the cab ride from the hotel to any broadway shows or midtown shopping....although we found that Soho has as much to spend your money on as the midtown shops. We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a fantastic experience and the ability to never worry about anything since the hotel has already done it for you.,Sep-11,1028569,4,118338317,5,michael n
“By far the best hotel I have stayed at in NYC”,"The Greenwich Hotel is so superb that I find myself writing my first hotel review ever. The entire staff is so lovely and polished. The rooms are beautiful and clean. The free mini bar selection is a fun perk. The pool is heavenly. The food is to die for.
I genuinely can not say enough good things about the hotel. Only thing that may not be for everyone is that it is located far downtown and also that the hotel is so lovely you won't want to leave and see the city.",Feb-11,1028569,2,118022052,5,Ivy D
“We loved it.”,"Fantastic Hotel in the Tribeca/Soho district. Beautiful rooms and comfortable beds with loads of freebies in the room. The Hotel also has a town car at your disposal. Locanda Verde restaurant serves sensational food. A very trendy area of New York which was close to subways, restaurants and the Financial district as well as Soho shopping. The Hotel swimming pool was a perfect serene retreat in this busy city. I would highly recommend that you stay here, Especially since you may get a sighting of the owner, Mr Robert De Niro.",Aug-11,1028569,21,117643126,5,babyboomer58sydney
“Best hotel in NYC!”,"My husband and I have spent three long weekends at the Greenwich in the last three years. It's a wonderful
boutique hotel in Tribeca. Off the beaten track but in an interesting area. Good restaurants and walks nearby. The rooms are large (for New York)
and quirkily furnished but very comfortable. There's a large free basket of snacks in each room, an amazing
deep bathtub, a bar which feels like an English hunting lodge and a beautiful courtyard. We've travelled to New York frequently for business and pleasure and this is the hotel we will keep returning to.",Nov-10,1028569,6,117547969,5,Proust101
“Excellent service & amenities”,"My husband and I stayed at the Greenwich in NYC to attend a party being held at the adjacent restaurant, Loconda Verde. Both the restaurant and hotel are owned by Robert DeNiro. Upon arrival, the staff was extremely attentive, and since our room was not ready, directed us to the lounge and connect courtyard to have a drink and relax. The inner courtyard and lounge can only be accessed by hotel guests, and is quite lovely. The decor of the lobby is a rustic/chic with paintings on the wall by DeNiro's father, reminiscent of Matisse and Modigliani and they are quite good. We heard from the staff that the hotel took 3 years to build, as he brought craftsman and stonemasons from Italy to create a hotel that looks as though it as been there for a long time. It was a former parking garage.
The pool is in the basement, and it has be designed to look like a japanese teahouse, dark and misty and the adjacent spa and gym room(which we did not use) appeared very inviting. 
Our room, on the second floor was beautifully appointed without being opulent. Quality reigns throughout, with a lovely setee and desk instead of traditional ugly hotel room chair and office style desk. Also in the room was a leather lounge chair in front of a large window with a seat to look out at the city. We had no problem with street noise at all.
The bed was perfect with quality linens. In the bathroom was the most gorgeous tile on the walls I've ever seen with a large shower and the option of two different types of shower head, depending on your preferences and height - how great! A extremely surprising perk, was the snack basket, filled with quality goodies (not junk food) that was absolutely free! Yes free! Actually, everything in the minibar was free except the alcohol, and we took advantage of the water, juices and sodas. Oh, and a plate of homemade cookies was brought to our room upon check in. 
One more note as to service: At check out, it was pouring rain. There was an umbrella in our room and we brought it down to the front desk to ask if we could purchase it. The staff responded - "" thank you for asking us first, but you are welcome to take it with you."" Who does that?
We loved it and would highly recommend it.",Aug-11,1028569,27,117223487,5,nancylarry
“Favorite Hotel”,"The Greenwich is one of my favorite Hotels in the world. The desk staff is right on target, courteous helpful and makes you feel like a VIP without being obsequious. The rooms are beautiful, the scent in the rooms divine, the bed and bedding, pillow etc are perfect. Free snacks and drinks in the room are great, but they should have some kind of dark chocolate. If you are staying in the Tribeca/SoHo area you have a number of wonderful choices. It is really a toss up between The Mercer and The Greenwich. I do prefer the Greenwich.",Aug-11,1028569,9,117074670,5,Alan R

“Bettwäsche zerrissen und nicht gewechselt”,"I made a reservation directly with the hotel for a stay from to April 2011. We arrived on the afternoon of April at the hotel. The first room that was presented was in contrary what I had ordered – instead of a quiet room we received a room to the main street and to the entrance to a 24 hours car garage. We declined this particular room and the next was shown which was to the courtyard. But somebody had put a desk in the room which crossed the bed by 20 cm at the pillow. I did not want to get up at night and be knocked down by the edge of the desk. So we waited for an acceptable room. The whole procedure took about 1 hour of accumulated time. We had left in between to see something else than the hotel entrance and unfriendly staff’s faces.
At about 7.00 p.m. the desk manager gave us a room which was facing the courtyard and was arranged to some satisfaction. It was still far away from a room you would expect for $ 750.00 (!) per night. For compensation (!) we were told that the drinks in the fridge were free – except for alcoholic ones. Then some child-pleasing bubbles and other junk food were highlighted as complimentary. But the highly praised balcony by the manager turned out as faux balcony at daylight, about 5 inches deep.
At the first morning we realized that the linen had a hole and looked a bit tired.
On the next and final morning we found exact that hole again plus a lot of other holes in the linen. This was what you would expect in a waste bin.
Now we knew that the linen was not changed at least 2 nights – how long might it have been on the bed before we came? - even for $ 750.00 a night.
By checking out we claimed all these items and wanted an explanation which we did not received nor any way of “sorry for that”, but lots of excuses.
This experience with a hotel claimed by some critics as best of New York is a shame. Your organization should check the quality standard and the service. It is miles away from the level of a being accepted as member of the “L HW”.

“Serenity in the Big City”,"Very warm and comfortable hotel in Tribeca.
Not noisy and full of ""Party-ers"" like some other downtown hotels.

“Amazing hotel in New York”,"My husband and I stayed at The Greenwich Hotel for a week in June.We searched through trip advisor for somewhere to stay in the Greenwich, Tribecca area and were very pleased we managed to get a room here. This hotel doesn't look much from the outside (you could actually miss it ) but inside it has the luxury of a home away from home.
The rooms are very spacious, modern with a homely feel and have everything you need for a relaxing stay. The huge bed was really comfortable, the bath was amazingly deep and filled in a really short time. As others have said the free mini bar(excluding alcohol)and the lovely snacks were a great treat at the end of a full on day exploring New York.
What we really loved about this place was it's position. Close to the Hudson river where we could go walking in the morning,surrounded by some of the best Restaurants in NY and close to the subway but far enough away from the hustle and bustle to relax in the evening.
The outdoor garden was lovely. A great place for a glass of wine in the evening or breakfast in the morning. Also the guest lounge was very inviting with its huge overstuffed couches and comfy chairs and the fire place gave it just the right touch of ambiance.The restaurant down stairs was delicious but not cheap.
I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a great NY experience and the chance to catch a celebrity or two.(we did).We will definitely return if we make another trip to NY.
The staff were friendly and helpful and although we didn't use the pool it looked inviting.",Jun-11,1028569,12,116588556,5,PAB3
“top tier hotel experience”,"I'm a frequent business traveler. New York is always hard because rooms are typically small, and the prices are high. While I certainly had to pay a lot for my room (a couple of steps up from the bottom tier pricing), the decore was gorgeous, everything was clean and new.
I've spent some time at the hip Ace hotel and will never go back there now that I've found the Greenwich. It's a true class act without a bunch of loud 20-somethings running around.
Hard to beat the nicely portioned free mini-bar.
Courtyard for breakfast and evening drinks with colleagues was great.
Checkin/out is no fuss; very simple and quick. Professional staff all the way around.
My only complaint would be that, as an early riser, I was generally the first patron to arrive for breakfast and they weren't fully prepared and I felt like I causing everything to get going which wasn't ideal.
I'll absolutely be back! Great location (just blocks away from the Hudson River greenway thing where you can go running. I'll likely bring family with me (spouse and 2 kids) as there's an amazing playground thing on said greenway.
Oh yea, the sub-terrainean pool is ultra cool.",Jun-11,1028569,11,116025842,5,jvaleski
“Fantastic!”,"I stayed at The Greenwich for my Birthday recently & had an amazing stay! The hotel is located in Tribeca, a lovely, calm neighborhood in NYC, set on a cobblestoned st. I arrived early around 11am, & my room was ready. I had never stayed at the hotel before, & while the Front Desk Agent who checked me in was nice, I wasn't given an info. on the hotel, etc. I'm quite familiar w/ the property, so this wasn't necessary for me, but just something to mention. To access the elevator, you must use your key, which I wasn't aware of until I figured this out (this is something that should have been mentioned...again, just a note) My room (#503) was on the 5th fl. & incredibly quiet, lovely & super in terms of design, colors, etc. I loved my room! The pale yellow walls, clean hard wood floors, amazing Duxiana bed, soft sheets, & amazing bathroom done in beautiful Orange & White tiles were all great! The mini-bar was extremely well-stocked & all items were complimentary, with the exception of the wine & liquor. Everything was provided from Mexican Coca Cola, Fiji Water, Pineapple Juice, Ginger Ale, to a lovely basket of snacks, including Kettle Chips, Cookies, Nuts, Swedish Fish, etc....I thoroughly enjoyed the mini-bar & it was so nice to have it all included! nice touch guys!
The Desk area was spacious with outlets, & nice bookshelves w/ a cool selection of books, objects, & a little jar of candy! so nice! The Flat screen T.V. had clear reception, the sitting area had a comfy sofa, the windows opened which was great, the A/C made the room incredibly cold, which I love, & the closet was spacious, with a safe, slippers, padded hangers, etc. The bathroom had an absolutely amazing waterfall Rain Shower that was truly the best I've had in a hotel!!! I never wanted to get out.....the deep-soaking tub was also pure bliss! The Red Flower products have a lovely masculine scent & I also loved the soap. The towels were super great, the Frette robes were cool for the Summer & the light fixtures above the sink were amazing! The WC is in a seperate alcove which is nice. The pressure in the shower & tub were 100% flawless! 
I just loved the overall feeling of my room....light, airy, cool & beautifully unique in terms of design & colors! The rug was also great....so many unique, special touches in the room! I was celebrating my birthday, so the hotel sent a lovely card w/ Champagne(which I don't drink, so they sent a cupcake-thanks alot!) A welcome note from the hotel w/ 2 Oatmeal Sandwich cookies were awesome!!! The lobby & drawing room w/ outdoor courtyard were great & my meals from Room service were amazing! great food & arrived very quick. 
Everything was absolutely perfect during my stay! All bellmen were very nice & charming, Matt at the front desk granted me a late 1:30pm check-out that was much appreciated & Lauren & Jonathan were very nice, as well at the Front Desk. I loved the hotel & will def. be back soon!

“The best hotel I've ever stayed in.”,"Walking into the Greenwich is amazing. From the outside you wouldn't even look twice but similar to many things in NYC the true beauty is going inside and exploring. There is an amazing pool (the only complaint could be that it would be great if it were heated) - and steam room. All of the common areas oozing old Hollywood charm. Considering that Robert De Niro owns the hotel this doesn't come as a massive shock - his taste is classy and inviting. The service was impeccable, the room was amazing and the whole place was complete luxury. We saw many movie stars there including Ted Danson and Cameron Diaz. Perfect place to celebrity watch.",Jun-11,1028569,9,115683342,5,danykelly
"“Edgy, unassuming, & elegant!”","We thought this was a very nice and friendly establishment. There is a beautiful, brick courtyard with all sorts cool plants in different containers right off the main lobby. I had lunch out there from the Italian restaurant next door, and it was delicious. Later in the evening, my husband and I sat in the courtyard and had a cocktail while he smoked a cigar. The rooms are all different. The first room they gave us looked out onto Greenwich Street, and since I didn't care for the view, I asked to see another. They were happy to oblige, and showed me another room (which was an upgrade) that looked onto Franklin St, and I choose that room. Some of the rooms have soaking tubs, while others only have a shower, which was the case in this room. However, the shower was awesome, with cool, Moroccan tile and a large ""railhead"" shower head. The floors are all wooden, the hallways are darkened, it's very quiet and wonderfully decorated. I was told most of the paintings in the lobby were painted by Robert De Niro's father. The hotel used to be a parking lot, and it took 4 years to complete, with over 20 styles of brick used in the construction of the hotel.
 Tip: because we used our AMEX platinum card to book our reservation (July '11), Greenwich gave us an automatic room upgrade, $25 per person voucher for breakfast, and a $100 voucher for a spa service. 
 I booked a spa service for the following morning, which I enjoyed very much. The spa is in the lowest level and has a nice gym, also. There are unisex bathrooms/locker rooms each with steam rooms and showers. You walk through here to get to the pool area, which is beautiful. The water was a tad murky, and I know they were working on the water issue as I saw a maintenance man talking to the pool attendant. I would have given the pool 5 stars if not for the murky water.

"“Terrific hotel, great location - loved it”","My wife and I spent a weekend at the Greenwich Hotel last month. It was terrific, and we will definitely stay there again on our next trip. Location is great - 1 block from the Hudson River and great walking/jogging trails along the river, great neighborhood full of small cafes and boutiques and interesting shops.
Our room was very nice. We loved the interesting but comfortable furniture, and the great bed. The rooom felt cozy and comfortable, but also hip and interesting. Appreciated the complimentary soft drinks, snacks, and large water bottles - a nice touch, and so refreshing for a hotel to actually include something ""extra"" with your room.
The hotel has a lovely courtyard where you can eat a quiet breakfast (and other meals if you like). Service in the courtyard was a little slow, but not annoyingly so. I just think the place has a laid back feel about it, and who wants to rush when you are sitting on a comfy couch in a pretty courtyard drinking good coffee. We had a very good Sunday brunch meal here. 
Oh, and the spa is worth a visit. We had a short couples soak in the Japanese tub, which was glorious and I only wish we had booked a longer soak, followed by great massages. The pool area is serene!

“Tribeca gem”,"The Grenwich is a great hotel. The rooms are interestingly decorated and well appointed. It feels less like a big city hotel than like a very well designed and staffed private members club.
The location, in Tribeca, is great for downtown, and for restaurants and bars. Less good, of course, if you are in NYC for Fifth Avenue shopping, Central Park etc. But Manhattan is a small place, and everywhere is in reach.
The food and bar at the Greenwich are absolutely outstanding. the restaurant in house, Locanda Verde, does some of the best Italian food I have eaten - it would be one of the very best restaurants in Bologna, Rome or any other foodie Italian city.
The small touches at this hotel, like the free minibar and constantly replenished basket of very fun old-school American snack (things like Smuckers, as well as normal M7Ms and other typical brands) really make a difference.
There is one weakness I think the Greenwich hotel has compared to the traditional five star hotels like the Plaza, Ritz Carlton et al is with the concierge. I felt that as a smaller and more recent hotel the concierge desk did not have the contacts or the pull to make hard to get reservations with restaurants in the city. We asked for a few reservations that weren't possible, and, although I can't be certain, I think the concierge at one of the big name city hotels might have been able to make it happen.
However, this is a minor weakness in a very excellent hotel, and I would happily recommend it to anyone for either a holiday or for business.",Dec-10,1028569,28,113369400,5,SMI64
“Interesting and pleasant despite small room”,"The design and location of the hotel are interesting (in a good way) and much thought has clearly gone into appointing the rooms, which are efficiently laid out but have much character. Perhaps it is a feature of New York, but the size of the rooms is a problem (mine was fine, but it was in the middle of the price range, so I can't imagine what the smaller ones are like.) The service is a little haphazard, with many of the attractive staff clearly not chosen for their ability to solve problems. The lounge for guests only (a great touch) is wonderful, even more so because one can order from the restaurant menu but be removed from the bustle of the restaurant itself. Not cheap.",Jan-11,1028569,82,112079762,5,pcinbk

The rooms are ""rustic"" with part wooden floor and part old furniture, but it's all been refurbished as e.g. the beautiful old closet had lights installed.

The aesthetic is an interesting blend of tribeca zen rustic chic (if that makes any sense at all) with some buddha statues, wide plank wood floors and funky light fixtures.

My budget does not allow me to stay in a larger room but have frequently gotten upgraded. I love the cozy room that face the courtyard with small balconies. Makes me feel as if I am in a little apartment.
The living room area that is open only to guests, as well as the outdoors garden, are perfect spots to meet with others or work. Service is great....and you can order from the attached restaurant Locande Verde.
Lots of great dining options within a few blocks and Soho shopping is not too far.
As a business traveler I find this place to be a great getaway. If you are working in mid-town you will need to give yourself time to travel but it is worth it.

“Luxurious and homely hotel with excellent service to match”,"This hotel has a real homely feel to it and like other reviewers have commented it really does feel as if you are staying at somebody’s house. 
On arrival we were shown to the hotel bar and served some complimentary coffees – actually it’s not a bar it’s far too homely and comfortable to be called a bar. We were seated near the open log fire – what a treat that is when it’s freezing outside. 
We were upgraded to a larger room which was like a suite with a large bathroom with walk in rain shower. All drinks and food in the mini-bar were complimentary (apart from alcohol). All the staff were incredibly down to earth and very friendly and helpful especially Jonathan who always had a smile on his face as he greeted you. 
We ate at the hotel restaurant which was always packed (a good sign). The restaurant food was very high quality and the service matched the hotel. Sometimes when you’re eating in a very busy restaurant the service can lapse – not the case in the Locande Verde. They also have an interesting selection of Italian wines. 
The pool , spa and gym areas are also fantastic. We had the pool to ourselves most of the time and it has a very eastern (Thai) feel to it. The gym is modern and well equipped. 
The location (Tribeca) is a quiter area than Soho but there’s still lots of interesting places to eat and drink. We went to the Terrior Tribeca which is an excellent bar / restaurant where you can sample many different wines from around the world. 
I could go on … but it’s all good and I have nothing but high praise for this hotel. We stayed 2 nights here and then transferred to the Mercer in Soho (see my review also). The girl on reception told us that the Mercer is good but not as good as the Greenwich. They are different hotels and both excellent in their own way but there’s no doubt that I would return to the Greenwich everytime. Thank you very much Mr De Niro.",Jan-11,1028569,42,94611598,5,nrty
“I truly did not want to leave...”,"Well, this will be my home away from home from now on when doing business in NYC. If you like attention to detail and being made to feel very special, then you'll like it here also. Business travelers, do yourself a favor and reward and try out the Greenwich instead of the same old same old. I had no wants here, everything I could possibly need was provided perfectly. The staff were universally wonderful and also very attractive. My room was a study in detail, not ostentatious but always left me with a feeling of being taken care of so perfectly. The volume of water the shower put out was sinful! The dux bed was perfect, the Italian linens luxurious, the food was delicious, free non-alcohol drinks and snacks just great. If you are traveling for business and want to feel all warm and happy returning each night to your hotel after a long work day, then do yourself a favor and give the Greenwich a try.",Jan-11,1028569,0,92852232,5,tempron
“A gorgeous understated luxury retreat”,"I have now stayed at The Greenwich Hotel twice since it has opened and have had a fantastic experience both times. I have traveled all over the world for both business and pleasure and tend to prefer and intimate hotel experience and this hotel does not disappoint. I always state this as being in my top three favorite hotels in the world thus far. I have stayed in both the smallest room, the Courtyard rooms as well as a larger Superior room. Both of these rooms are large by New York standards and both feel like you are staying at someone's comfortable understand wonderful home. The library lounge and the restaurant are both fantastic as well. The only downside is the price as I would stay there much more often, however it is very worth it.",Jan-11,1028569,5,91775324,5,ChiKYtraveler
“Fab hotel”,"We stayed at the Greenwich for 3 nights at the end of our honeymoon which we had spent in the Caribbean. We had such a great time here and loved the hotel. We spent so much time researching where was best to stay and we were so pleased with our choice. In the end we chose this over the Mercer and are really pleased we did. The Greenwich has loads of charm, the bedrooms are great, the bathrooms amazing. We loved the touches such as a whole box of American goodies in our room each day and champagne we were left on the first night. We only ate at the hotel before we caught our flight on the last day - the food was fantastic and we really wish we had eaten there before. The staff are really friendly and the service is overall very good. There was a bit of noise around our room during the night a couple of times which was annoying but other than that this is such a great place to stay. Good location, great swimming pool and gym etc if you want to use it. Would highly recommend and would definitely go back when next in NYC.",Jun-10,1028569,9,91133790,5,aikens
“A genuine home from home but quieter and with great service”,"You get what you pay for and whilst the Greenwich isn't cheap you get something other hotels need to aspire to - ultra quiet luxurious rooms with truly excellent service and a touch of class. 
So you know our type of hotel, our other NYC visits have included the Soho Grand (nice but moody staff), Tribeca Grand (nice but noisy), 60 Thompson (average) and the Hudson (cool but tiny tiny rooms).
Our stay started with a swift paperless check-in and personal escort to the room. Fast Wi-Fi, snacks (sweets, crisps etc) and all mini-bar soft drinks are included in the rate - a nice touch and takes away the feeling of being ripped off or worried about using the facilities. We were upgraded too - from a superior to a deluxe - not quite sure why :-).
The room itself was 7th floor facing North Moore St. Big comfy bed, soft pillows (harder ones were provided on request), plenty of space, deep bath, big telly, robes and an extra door to keep corridor noise out. I can't emphasise how quiet this hotel was. House keeping were ultra discreet and never seen (in fact we saw them actually hiding at one point!).
A DVD player and movies were available, the pool was breath taking, the breakfast was delicious and room service was excellent with orders arriving within minutes for easy things and on time for larger orders.
Location is great if you like the quiet side of New York. Tribeca is like a different country compared to Time Square etc.
The photo's on the site don't overstate what you get - lovely design and all really comfy and cosy.
The only downsides are (and these are aimed at hotel management really as quite picky)...
- With the room being hard to leave it would be nice to have tea making facilities
- The restaurant temperature was either really cold (to the point of having to wear a coat on two occasions) to really stuffy
- Soft close toilet seats - every hotel needs em!
All round top class and will go again.",Nov-10,1028569,9,87298531,5,Bodwin
"“very good, just slightly too cool”","I accidentally booked a room at both the Ace Hotel and the Greenwich one weekend, and after checking out the Ace I moved immediately to the Greenwich, which is vastly superior to the Ace (if much more expensive). The room I saw at the Ace was dark and cold-feeling, whereas the Greenwich feels like a warm if slightly spartan room in a rich friend's European lodge. I loved the comfy bed, the spaciousness of the room, and the sophisticatedly simple decor. That said, the Greenwich didn't feel entirely ideal to me. The wood finishings in the hallways look too new or something-- they seem to be going for an old lodge feel, but in that case they need to have that heavy wood piney smell, and they don't, so it just feels weird (perhaps this is because I grew up going to old lodges in the mountains that all had a very heavy scent of pine). The hard wooden floors were cool but like the hallway, felt like they needed some age or heft or something, or maybe just some warmer, furry area rugs-- something to warm up the space just a bit.
Things I liked: I loved the shower, very luxe. The pool and steam room were also luxurious. The library room on the first floor was beautiful; I made sure to stop there every evening on the way in to my room. Generally speaking, I slept well and felt warm and coddled by the space, if just slightly less comfortable than I would have felt had they somehow solved the new/hard surfaces problem.",Oct-10,1028569,23,86477345,4,kaytchinha

“Manhattan Oasis”,"The Greenwich Hotel in TriBeCa is an elegant hotel with European charm. What stands out in my memory is the cozy lobby with a roaring fire place, the bare wood floors with area rugs, the deep soaking tubs. And the subterrainian pool that they will open any time of night. Of course the kid loved the giant fish bowl full of candy for which the hotel does not charge a penny. The hotel restaurant is also great.",Dec-09,1028569,1,83135354,5,jrbnyc
“O-A-S-I-S!!”,"The Greenwich has quickly become our FAVORITE hotel in NYC!! Regardless of where in the city our destination is.....we LOVE it there!! Stepping through the doors...you feel immediately welcome....front desk staff has always been lovely...and although our room is always ready immediately....we will often choose to have a cocktail in the beautiful library first !! The pool and spa are absolutely beautiful....the rooms perfectly appointed!! (the only problem are all of the ""treats"" you are obligated to sample in the ""goody bin"")...Did I mention the shampoo/conditioner and soap????????

“favorite place in the city”,"I have stayed at the Greenwich several times, both with friends as well as my spouse. Every stay was a wonderful experience ! The staff have always been very friendly & accommodating. The rooms were all different and extremely relaxing & private. Luxury abounds, from the tile bathrooms to the bedrooms. 
My favorite place in the hotel is the ""library"" ! Very romantic place for drinks & even dinner....",Sep-10,1028569,0,82201603,5,kffunk
“Absolute Perfection”,"First off, I must to say, I’m shocked to read reviews about a lack of atmosphere or inadequate service. I just got back from an amazing 4 night stay at the Greenwich Hotel that was nothing short of perfection. The staff was warm and welcoming; the drawing room and courtyard were charming; and my room was simply wonderful (the bathroom was especially amazing- gorgeous deep soaking tub). The overall vibe was more genuine and intimate than any other boutique I’ve visited in Manhattan. I find that sometimes the “luxury” category can carry a degree of pretentiousness that clouds a more honest charm. The Greenwich is defined by this charm. 
I’ve stayed in NYC a good amount over the past 20 years and am thrilled to have found what is truly a hidden gem. As a self proclaimed veteran of the New York hotel scene, the Greenwich earns my highest recommendation. There is no doubt I will be back.",Sep-10,1028569,0,82100357,5,OliverSteel
“Absolutely Amazing & Beyond Expectations”,"This hotel was a recommendation from our friends who stayed here quite a few times and for also their anniversary - they absolutely love The Greenwich. We usually stay at the Mercer but decided to give this hotel a try. A few days prior to arriving at the hotel, I called to make a few requests and spoke with a gentleman who said his name was Matt. We explained to him that we tried to book the restaurant ""Locanda Verde"" but was unsuccessful and told that there was no tables available. He was able to confim our reservation for the restaurant with no problem and also help me make a decision on a show to see while on our trip to New York - he too helped us get the show tickets and great seats. It was raining quite a bit and when we arrived at the hotel, we were ushered from our taxi into the hotel by one of the doormen who was waiting with a courtesy umbrella welcoming us to the hotel. Our check-in was a breeze. We receive warm smiles & a friendly welcome. We were showed to our room by Katie who was a doll. She answered all our questions and alleviate a few concerns. In all our first time staying here was magnificant. I can honestly say that The Greenwich is our new home away from home.",Sep-10,1028569,0,82090431,5,SouthernBelle4075
“not up to expectations - a little disappointing”,"I thought the Greenwich would compare to the Mercer in service, atmosphere and amenities...but unfortunately it is very difficult to find anything that makes the Greenwich stand out; except for the free snacks and non-alcoholic drinks in your room.
the biggest issue with the hotel is it lacks atmosphere; first time I stayed in a NYC hotel and didn't look forward to spend a night in the bar. Everything feels so ""slow"" and boring.
La locande verde: very atypical breakfast menu and very inflexible so ended up taking my breakfast outside the hotel. 
Spa: impressive swimming pool (unfortunately ""in repair"" during my whole stay) but services are not unique and wildly over-priced (go to the Mandarin Oriental for a really impressive experience if you are willing to pay these prices)
Room: lacks imagination; bath tub too small. Good sized products are a plus. The main problem with the room though are the floors; they make an incredible noise...
Staff was okay although ""no way"" they could arrange a late check-out.
also, booked transportation service from/to the airport and never have seen such an expensive service.
So, unfortunately, I will not return to the Greenwich. if you want to test it for yourself, make sure you get an incredible deal.",Sep-10,1028569,196,81859480,3,ErwinFromBelgium

“Amazing Hotel - Sloppy Staff - Wont Stay Again...”,Greenwich Hotel has many fantastic features - my room was lovely with a very comfortable bed and great interiors - the drawing room and courtyard room were relaxing and intimate and the restaurant was fun and had great food - all was going great BUT.... what the hell went wrong with the Reception staff?? The girl that checked us in was chewing gum like a cow and no one was wearing uniforms or name tags despite about 4 people standing behind the reception desk and looking at me like i had just rudely interrupted their conversation - what a crap way to be introduced to the hotel - especially when paying $500+ a night and hoping that the greeting would be much more personal and professional - i felt like i was checking into a back packers hostel. This unwelcoming vibe from the reception staff was hard to escape during our stay - which is such a shame because i wont stay again despite the hotel being truly beautiful. Oh and by the way - expect to be barked at if you take any photos in the hotel - a notice would be sufficient - but the reception staff really dont want you to capture any memories of your stay at the hotel...(good and bad),Aug-10,1028569,54,81286191,3,Bella1111
“Very relaxing oasis in New York”,"I had never stayed in Tribeca before and was completely charmed by it; I usually stay at the Mercer but have found that Soho can sometimes be very crowded and busy. Tribeca does not have anything like the same number of shops and, as a result, it has a much more laid back feel. And this hotel is just such a relaxing place to stay. The rooms are very nicely done; the bathrooms are gorgeous, but most of all the bar and courtyard reserved for guests are ideal places to while away the time insulated from the hustle and bustle of New York. And the food in the courtyard is excellent too. 
I liked the way one could walk up to Soho in 10 minutes or over to the waterfront (with its fabulous views) in 5. I loved all the restaurants nearby especially Harrison which always seemed to be buzzing with happy diners. But if I wanted to stay in, there was always the courtyard to retreat to and it was especially magical lamplit at night-time. 
I did not find the staff to be at all offputting (as other reviewers have suggested)- they were generally very professional and warm. 
If I had a complaint it was that I thought the sound proofing was poor for a hotel of this standard but earplugs at night blocked out the noise of creaking wooden doors and corridors and also the occasional noise of traffic outside. And I suppose that noise is one of the occupational hazards of a city like New York.",Sep-10,1028569,130,79770320,5,Irishguest
“Great hotel but front of house staff with attitude”,"We have just returned from five nights at this hotel - the hotel itself is great, great location - lots of restaurants around and very quiet at night - best of all is the mini bar and basket of goodies which are all free (except alcohol) and replenished daily. 
Unfortunately our stay was marred by unhelpful and rude front desk staff, we had a problem with our special travel mastercard which we had charged up with dollars - because you get a better rate - on arrival we gave the card, but what we did not know was that the hotel 'reserves' $200 a day on top of the room charge (so an additional $1000 in our case) - the result was that all of the money on our card was in effect used up and the following day we tried to use it and it was declined - after talking to the card company we discovered what the hotel had done - completely without telling us - the hotel said it was a standard thing to do, we have travellled all over the world and have never come across this - i'd be interested to hear if anyone else has ? we would not have minded if we had been told but sorting out the result of this took 3 days as the money did not go back on the card so could not be used - anyway, the point is how the staff dealt with the situation - it is like dealing with robots, they were very fake and pretended to understand - it was very frustrating - as someone else said in a review, the particular person who dealt with us was confrontational and comletely unhelpful. Stay at this hotel but be wary of the front desk staff and dont excpect help if you have any problems.",Sep-10,1028569,2,78807684,3,markdelacourt

“Tribeca jewel that offers intimacy and old world charm with uneven front of house staff”,"Chose Greenwich Hotel based on rave reviews from friends. Unfortunately, my check-in experience marred my impression of the hotel. Although I had a confirmation for my stay, the front desk clerk coldly stated she didn't have my record, then claimed I was a no-show (and charged my cc for a night) for an alleged arrival 2 nights prior. Rather than apologize and try to set things straight, she took a confrontational pose and made me feel that I made a mistake. Long story short: she found me a room (same category I booked), but I never felt welcome my 2 nights there. I had a friend with me who witnessed this exchange, and she was shocked by how it was handled.
Despite this sour start, I did like my room and found the public spaces stunning and well worth a visit. The courtyard patio is a lovely escape. My husband and I noted and enjoyed the special touches like generous candy and room amenities, internet access, the chalk board by the elevators that provided the weather report, the news rack by the elevator, nicely appointed gym, and beautiful plantings. We also liked the range of room choices since many NYC hotels have limited choices for those who prefer larger rooms. The hotel is worth visiting just to see a space that is a new build, but totally of another era.
Back to the bad check-in: I'd say it points to poor front desk training and mastery of customer service. Check-in is what sets the first impression of a hotel! Based on this exchange, I had fear that I'd have a problem (even with my email confirmation of my stay) getting my credit card refunded for the ""no-show"" stay. Thankfully, the reservation manager had it all taken care of the next morning without incident. We've stayed at the Mercer (a sister property) and found the staff professional and personable, which is not what I'd say about the Greenwich (except for the spa desk attendant and the charming housekeeper), where most of the staff had an air of exasperation and disgust.",Aug-10,1028569,9,75534271,3,GoldenGooseLV

“HEAVENLY PERFECTION!!”,A friend had suggested The Greenwich Hotel as a place to stay while we were in NYC celeberating my husband's 60th. Being frequent visitors to the city over the last 20 years and having numerous hotels we both love - I thought I would take a chance and try it out. WELL - I don't want to stay anywhere else anymore!! From the moment we checked in to the moment we left 3 days later there was never one misstep. Even prior to our arrival I had numerous email communications with the General Manager to help me arrange dinner reservations and theatre tickets. Again - perfection. The bed and pillows - heaven. The bathroom - again - heaven. The private coutyard and the bar/lounge were wonderful to relax in. A must to experience.,Jul-10,1028569,1,74629971,5,SLP_10
“Absolutely perfect!”,"The best service, food, and beautiful hotel. The lobby, library and courtyard are very well designed, with a rich color palette and interesting furniture. The courtyard is a dream, open to the sky and landscaped with tall bamboo and garden sculptures.
We stayed in room 514, with French doors overlooking the courtyard. The bed was great-gorgeous sheets. The tile work in our bathroom was breathtaking, very nicely appointed. Lots of storage and quite a spacious layout.
The food at Locanda Verde was excellent, the prices fair. The hotel staff were more than accommodating, and made us feel just as welcome as the celebrities who were also staying at that time. We have stayed at The Standard, and the Gansevoort, and this hotel had larger, superior quality rooms, excellent food, and impeccable service.

“They have thought of everything”,"We stayed at the Greenwich for 3 nights at the beginning of May.
They were incredibly helpful before we arrived, managing to secure us a reservation at Per Se and calling beforehand to inform us that Greenwich Street was going to be closed due to the Film Festival so to be dropped off on North Moore and a bellboy would meet us on the corner to help with bags. i then assumed that the hotel was a bit down Greenwich Street but no, it was on the corner and there was no real need for the bellboy to help us, we could have wheeled our luggage the few extra steps.
I lived in NY in 2001 and Tribeca has changed so much since then that we decided to eat locally and after checking out the menu at the restuarant downstairs opted for that. It was fantastic. Great martinis, beautiful simple yet well executed food I couldn't recommend it more.
After trawling the various bars in the near vicinity (there are about 8 bars along North Moore Street between W Broadway and Greenwich) until who knows what time in the morning we came back and collapsed, waking late. We could hear no noise from the street and the room was lovely and dark, we obviously hadn't done this... the turn down service had been, closed the blinds, the nets and the thick curtains as well as closing the window and shutting out the noise of NYC. Bliss.
The bathroom was amazing, enormous rain head shower with lovely products (and lots of them) and sunken bath big enough for two and cotton buds and pads as well as vitamin booster sachets (very handy after the 8 bar crawl...)
The free snacks and soft drinks were fab (again particularly after the bar crawl) and the spa a perfect antidote to the bustle of the city streets, serene, dimly lit, warm and with a fantastic steam room in the changing rooms.
We loved this place, they couldn't have been more helpful, efficient and it seems that in the room they had thought of everything. If I had a pair of ruby slippers i would be clicking them together now saying ""there's no place like home"" and I would be sent there.",Mar-10,1028569,3,64729691,5,happyholidayhippo
“The most delightful stay ever!”,"We stayed 3 nights and it was all it took to become my favorite hotel in NYC. 
I absolutely loved this hotel!!! It is so inviting and beautiful. The minute you walk in you feel at home, because of its decor and just the overall comfortable ambiance. 
Beautiful furniture everywhere. Each room has a different decoration, eclectic yet so tasteful! I loved the library. We had brunch on Sunday in front of the fireplace while reading the newspaper. It was windy and cold that day, which made it even more perfect. 
The Pool/Spa area is awesome! Who would have thought a pool in the basement would look so nice! The pictures in the website dont do it justice. 
The restaurant offers so many different options. ALL delicious! You share every plate with the whole table which makes it great to converse and make dinner a fun event! 
I recommend the Ravioli, Lamb Rigatoni and the Pork Chop - DELISH!

“What a disappointment”,"If you are regularly stay at luxury boutique hotels then this one will really disappoint.
If you are easily pleased and just want to go for the cool name factor fine. 
Our first room had a wardrobe that could not be used properly - the door could not be shut and there was a huge scuff and rip on the wallpaper. We asked to be moved though the rug in the second room was dirty. Shabby chic does not equal uncleanliness.

"“Greenwich Hotel, Nirvana in NYC”","My wife's birthday was soon approaching and I was looking for something special and unforgettable that we could enjoy. I did some research and found that the Greenwich hotel style was attractive and the spa looked right up my wife's alley. So I booked a one bedroom corner fireplace suite for a Friday night getaway.
We arrived by car service from Long Island, and I must admit the hotel entrance is difficult to locate, but privacy is a perk of this location. Once in the lobby you are enveloped in a sensory tease of what is to come. Aroma hinting of peony's, colors and textures that warm your heart. 
We were welcomed by Hallelujah who was staffing the front desk. He asked for my name and then asked me if I was ready. I asked ready for what, he said we were upgraded, REALLY upgraded. He then lead us for a quick tour of the lobby and drawing room and to the elevators for a lift to the 6th floor. 
We were rewarded with an upgrade to the most unbelievable suite I have ever laid my eyes on, the Greenwich Suite, a two bedroom, two floored masterpiece with 30 foot windows and fireplace. We were speechless and on the verge of giddy as Hallelujah lead us on the grand tour. He explained the lighting system ( yes, all the lighting is networked) and the fact that we had entrances on both the 6th and 7th floors. Once the formal tour was over he left us to marvel at this suite. Every place your eyes stopped was an ocular delight. The old growth wood floors, the gray aged ceiling joists and panels, the majestic wall of windows overlooking the city, awesome. The dining table was reclaimed wood, and felt inviting to the touch. Placed on the table was fresh fruit, grapes, pears, apples and pomegranate that looked like it was in a still life portrait, my wife had to check to see if they were real. Propped on the fruit was a hand written note from the General Manager welcoming us to the Greenwich. 
There was a full kitchen ( like someone would cook here) and a fully stocked fridge that was gratis. There was a selection of beer, wine and liquor on hand along with a full ice maker. 
The bedroom was inviting, and warm. Doors opened to overlook the courtyard, which must be incredible in the late spring or early fall. The beds were by Duxiana. I have heard the commercials for Dux beds on Newsradio 880 for years and have always wanted to try them. Unfortunately, they were not for us. A little too firm for my tastes. 
The bathrooms were a marble paradise with a huge soaking tub and a walk in shower with a rain shower head. The robes were soft and towels plentiful. The toiletries were by Red Flower and were full sized (nice touch) and smelled incredible. You have to love the energy drink powder, yumm...zoom!
After an evening out on the town, we retired to bed and in the A.M. ordered room service breakfast. The sausage was yummy and the eggs were good enough to comment about, the were organic from an upstate farm. 
We had appointments at the spa, Shibui for 11 A.M. two 50 minute relaxation Swedish treatments. We were greeted by our therapists who proceeded kneed, rub and stretch us to a slumbery bliss. Let me take a minute to talk about the spa and pool. Wow, unbelievable. It was very warm in the pool area, with plenty of seating and lounge chairs. The spa locker rooms had steam showers that you did not want to leave. 
After the spa, our overnight was coming to a close. We stopped by the drawing room for coffee and were surprised to see that Mel Gibson chose to do the same at the table next to us. A cool way to close out a very cool overnight!",Nov-09,1028569,0,48827274,5,Chazmanjfk
“A very nice change from the other hotels in the city...”,"My girl and I have a tradition that we've started, which is to take a Friday night once every month or every other month and stay in a hotel in the city. Even though we both live here in our own nice apartments, it's nice to stay in a new place and have a romantic night in. The Greenwich Hotel was the place we picked for November 2009.
So far we've stayed at the Standard Hotel twice and the Gramercy Park Hotel once, and both have been fantastic experiences. This time we opted for something different, and thanks to Tablethotels.com, where I am a Tablet Plus member, we found this charming hotel. I had been to the restaurant, Locanda Verde, before, but I had never been inside the hotel. I'm glad we checked in.
i called the day of check-in to confirm my reservation and was told that we were upgraded to a one-bedroom suite from the Greenwich Deluxe room whicih we had originally booked for $695. When I arrived, I found out that the upgrade was no longer available because they had run out of room. I explained this to the desk clerk and how I had been told I was already upgraded and that they had not mentioned that it was ""subject to availability."" Well, instead of telling me that I was wrong, the desk clerk did some creative thinking and gave me the double upgrade to the corner suite, which was amazing.
The entire decor of the hotel is very European and reminds me of my time in London at the Mandarin Oriental. The bathroom is huge and marbled, and there are some very cool things like glass doors that swing open for the shower and the toilet, which are located in little compartments side by side. There is a large sunken tub that is wonderful for romantic evenings in, as well. And the bathroom amenities were full-size, like the SLS in Beverly Hills, where I stayed a few months ago for business.
The bed was very comfortable, and this room had a nice corner view of Greenwich and N. Moore. The room was decorated as if you had lived there for a decade, and everything was tasteful and of high quality. The old has an old, homey feel, and it doesn't feel like a hotel, which we both loved.
All of the munchies at the minibar were free, as were the non-alcoholic drinks--a very nice change. At check-in, we were given a nice bottle of cabernet and two fresh-baked cookies, along with two letters welcoming us (actually, a letter and a card), and a $50 spa voucher. (Some of these were benefits from being a Tablet Plus member.)
Even though our room was on the fourth floor, it was nice and quiet, and we had a romantic evening and then slept soundly the next morning.
Because of the Tablet Plus status, we actually had a guaranteed 4 p.m. late checkout, but we ended up checking out by 2 p.m. Sad, too--I would have loved to have stayed. There was a pool (rare in Manhattan), but we didn't have a chance to use it.
One more thing...we had dinner downstairs at Locanda Verde. The food is superb, and it has the feel of a neighborhood joint combined with something hipper. The food is amazing--try the ricotta cheese appetizer, the blue crab crostini, the pumpkin agnolotti, the mama's ravioli, and the lamb meatball sliders.",Nov-09,1028569,19,48793050,5,andergtr
“Unique NYC hotel”,"This is a fantastic hotel if you'd like to try something different to the classic NYC Manhattan hotel experience but still enjoy your 5* luxury. We were on a trip for my birthday and stayed in a Corner Suite which was much better than it looks in the pictures and not noisey at all (fourth floor). The room was very beautiful with a dining table, wet bar and sofas and had the feel of an Italian Villa more than a hotel room in NYC. Everything has already been said about the massive bathroom, luxury full size organic toiletries, wonderful ambiance of public rooms and great food in the restaurant. We found the staff very friendly and polite and even got a personal letter from the General Manager sent to our home thanking us for our comments on our experience at the hotel. If you do any research at all into the background of the building of this hotel and Robert De Niro's personal input into the decor and fittings you will appreciate the effort that has gone into all aspects of this unique hotel. We had a wonderful time and will definately be back. Highly recommended!",Oct-09,1028569,44,48354261,5,Onslow
“Better Places to Spend This Kind of Money”,"Service is good, location excellent, vibe is mellow.
Noise from the hallway is unacceptably loud (you can hear an entire conversation at ordinary levels through a closed door, which is all of about 10 feet from your bed, meaning it wakes you up). Also, the shades are sheer, so you can read in your room by 630am, with the lights off. Even if/when they fix these issues, it's a lot of money for not all that much - ordinary-sized room, ok furnishings, fine bathrooms, definitely not a place to remember and return to.",Oct-09,1028569,20,48287455,2,NYTravelGuy23
"“Very good, but with reservations”","Stayed here to try it out as previously stayed at Soho House (fav), Mercer (2nd fav) and The Bowery (least fav of the three).
My wife and I love design hotels, and The Greenwich lived up to expectations in terms of decor in most cases - in general really well done and good atmosphere all round. Borderline 'Swiss chalet' in some areas, but overall a good, warm design. We stayed in a deluxe Greenwich, and a few weird fittings in the room didn't seem to go very well (chandelier for one), but this was offset by the size, bathrooms and overall feel.
Staff were friendly and helpful in many cases - but there's certainly room for improvement - at the front desk in particular - and the speed of service in the communal areas could certainly be improved.
The spa is as good as it looks in the pictures, although the spa treatments seemed totally over the top price-wise - even for a hotel at this level. It's about double of similar places so I gave it a miss although I would have liked to try.
The Italian restaurant (which also served breakfast) was also good - although the breakfast itself was very lacking in terms of any kind of self service items (juice, cereals etc). By lacking i mean non-existent, with menu ordering only.
The courtyard's lovely.
There were a few negatives, and they would make me think twice about staying again.
Noise: The room was very noisy - we could hear another room like the occupants were in ours. May have been through the air vents or something. Unfortunately for us, the guests in that room were [--] all through the night and were [--] movie loud.
Several attempts to address this at front desk and get moved were pretty much dismissed and ignored. They said they were full, but to pay this money and not get any sleep is ridiculous - am sure they had higher spec rooms and should have moved us. Not good.
Perhaps that wouldn't have been quite so bad if the garbage truck didn't stop by outside our room at about 4:30-5am every morning for an hour, crushing rubbish. We had a room on the North Moore side, 4th floor, and I was woken up every morning - after an already reduced sleep. Not good again.
The best part of the room was the free basket of snacks and all soft drinks and water being free - not only that but they're topped up each day! A very nice touch.
Having checked my bill, it looks like they charged the posting of a letter I gave them at checkout to my credit card - £0.64p. Nothing technically wrong with that - but seems a bit petty and has never happened anywhere I've stayed before.
I've never stayed Tribeca before, and thought it was a nice change from Soho and Meatpacking, although in general we always walked into Soho as there's not too much to do around the area (although there is a great breakfast at Bubby's just round the corner)
All-in-all a good experience, but certainly wasn't made to feel special which is always what the end judgement comes down to. Why do these hotels insist on not having the front of house sorted out, and a bit more willing to please? Simple things like that are always the easiest to fix, and make the biggest difference to a guest.",Oct-09,1028569,20,48022284,4,travelling000
"“Noisy, noisy, noisy”","Stayed here on a business trip. Am used to city sounds but the noises from the restaurants were awful. Kept us up all night. Though the courtyard is beautiful, why ruin the scene with a lat nigh restaurant where most of the dinners are not even staying in the hotel.",Sep-09,1028569,5,41729791,2,eddiewish6
“Expensive! But amazing service... wram and wonderful.”,"Stayed here out of necessity (our hotel booking through a web service at another hotel was not honoured, and all else was booked), and paid well above what we planned, but...
It was beautiful, the staff were attentive, professional, yet casual and friendly. The room was comfortable, stylish, large, warm. ""Free"" treats, great toiletries, fab bathroom/shower.
And a spa in the basement!
Restaurants were A-1.
A great stay.",Sep-09,1028569,4,40417471,5,devsadvtrav
“Tasteful but pricey”,"The Greenwich Hotel is probably the most tastefully decorated hotel I have ever stayed in and I have stayed at over 100 hotels in the last 5 years. However, it also the second most expensive...
I stayed at the Greenwich despite the hotel being out of my price range because it was the only available hotel on Manhattan during Labour weekend 2009. The hotel has a very pleasant lobby and bar, a cosy courtyard and a well equipped gym and spa, which I unfortunately just had a brief look at. It is located in a residential and quiet part of Greenwich, but there is no shortage of restaurants and cafes nearby.
My room had lovely wooden floors, a very comfortable bed, electric curtains, excellent sound proofing, excellent AC system and a beautiful bathroom. Add to free non alcoholic drinks and snacks and I felt right at home.
My only complaint would be the free wifi, which was much too slow and hampered my work. Dont stay here if you need fast internet. For a romantic getaway, this hotel is perfect.",Sep-09,1028569,30,40126278,4,ChristianB
“Quite simply the best place in NYC”,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Greenwich Hotel for 3 nights and we did not want to leave. I wish we had booked a longer stay. We found our room to be extremely comfortable, peaceful and quiet. The windows kept out street noise and the heating/cooling system operated perfectly and with absolutely no noise. The public areas, such as the drawing room and the courtyard are awesome. They are comfortable and inviting while at the same time providing an elegance wherein you appreciate you're enjoying something special. We enjoyed glasses of wine in the drawing room and some wonderful meals in the courtyard. Often we had these rooms to ourselves. We also enjoyed the beautifully designed and very peaceful pool area. Every time we used the pool we were the only ones there.
I have already encouraged many friends to try this hotel and it's restaurant, Locanda Verde. The food at Locanda Verde is fantastic. If you're looking for a romantic and/or relaxing place to get away, I couldn't encourage you more strongly to try this hotel. The staff is generally young, very nice and accomodating.
We also enjoyed staying in TriBeCa. It's clean, safe and a bit slower paced. It's easy to get everywhere else in the city, including shopping in SoHo. It has some of the best restaurants all within an easy walk along beautiful city streets. 
We'll be back soon.",Jul-09,1028569,0,35591177,5,SCtNY
"“A wonderful, magical place!”","My wife and I stayed at The Greenwich last week, we needed a local vacation during some repair work on our apartment. Our stay was amazing, the staff is way above par, the cleanliness and atmosphere also were outstanding. We picked the hotel because we loved the interiors we had seen before. The rooms are super comfy, the bed was like home. You also have to see and enjoy the pool, a true wonder in NYC, not to mention the amazing music and atmosphere in the lobby lounge area, we enjoyed a few drinks there and will be back! Overall, it was a great, quiet and relaxing place to stay.",Jul-09,1028569,0,34249813,5,cashvillian
“Greenwich Hotel: Best In New York!”,"Just returned from two nights at the Greenwich Hotel wich is located in TriBeca. The place, opened last year by Rober De Niro, is positively the best place to stay in the city. Casual yet elegant with a young, very friendly staff that excelled at making my wife and I feel welcome. We had been delayed by the airline and had a 7:00 pm play to catch (the reason for the trip) and the staff helped rush us to our room after a quick check-in and had a cab waiting on us to quickly move us uptown to make the play just in time. The room featured a king bed with french doors that overlooked a pretty courtyard and was kitted out with very unusual items and a complimentary mini-bar. A large basket of snacks, ranging from chips to more exotic treats, was in a large wire basket, again no charge. The common rooms feature cool, very comfortable chairs and couches and a wood-burning fireplace adjacent to the open courtyard. The area was quiet, but there were many great restaurants within walking distance. The hotel restaurant had only recently changed hands and the Italian food was over the top. We dined there 2 nights in a row, something unheard of in a city with so many choices. Wake up call at 6 am the day of departure included the typical phone call, but also a knock on our door with a pot of hot coffee. Truly a wonderful over-all experience.",Date Unknown,1028569,23,32695905,5,brucemarsh
“Excellent hotel - we'll get back”,"Our first stay at this hotel - 4 nigths. Extremely friendly staff. The restaurant Laconda Verde is absolutely recommendable, lots of guests, good service and excellent food. Gym is really OK - we didn't try the Spa but it looks great. Complimentary Internet and non-alcoholic bar (plenty). The hotel is a bit pricy but value-for-money is top. Our room was beautiful (stayed at Superior Greenwich Room). We go to NYC once a year and this will also be our hotel next time. Johansen from Denmark.",Jun-09,1028569,1,31320669,5,CoupleCopenhagen
“Loved it..”,"Stayed three nights at The Greenwich Hotel and as the title suggests, we loved it. It's obviously a matter of personal taste, but we love the way they have decorated the hotel and the calm atmosphere that pervades. We stayed in a Deluxe Greenwich room which was lovely and very spacious by New York standards. We also took a look at a Corner Suite, which was beautiful and bigger than some friend's flats... and very expensive. Back in December '08 we stayed at the Gramercy Park Hotel for a few nights and the visit before that we were at the Mercer. The Greenwich is our clear favorite, the other two were good, but the staff at the Gramercy were a little too cool for school and the Mercer is excellent, but feels a little cramped. 
If we weren't so addicted to trying new hotels, this would be the one to make us stick and not twist.",May-09,1028569,13,31158880,5,bobsuncle
“A sophisticated escape”,"My husband and I chose this new hotel for a much-needed one-night getaway. The first room they brought us to smelled like smoke, which I noticed and mentioned immediately. The staff were gracious and admitted the problem (saying they ""can't police their guests"" and moved us to a nicer room even though they were ""fully committed."" The room was spacious with a king size bed, desk, armchair, a settee and other table. The bathroom was done in a unique spanish tile, and was very large with a dual-head shower. The bed was outrageously comfortable. We enjoyed the included (won't call them free for this price) snacks and bevs. We had massages at the spa which were excellent and given by the top guy there. The pool is warm and lovely. Our only complaints were an intermittent high-pitched whining sound, perhaps the elevator, and the fact that our breakfast did not arrive at the requested time and required two phone calls to resolve. Oh--and the wifi requires a password which they do not include in their printed guide--why not? All in all, a good stay and I wish we could afford to stay longer!",May-09,1028569,12,29342622,4,Atlas&Co.
“Charming hotel”,"I am a Tribeca resident, and I needed extra space for the Christmas holiday for my family so I selected The Greenwich Hotel. I was very pleased! The hotel exemplifies understated elegance. From the moment you walk into the hotel it feels as if you've escaped from the hectic city. The rooms are a bit pricey, but I felt it was certainly worth it. Each room is individually decorated....a bit eclectic and minimalist, but everything in the room is high quality. The mattresses are Duxiana, and the toiletries were generous portions of Red Flower products (one of my favorites). There was even a wonderful complimentary snack basket in the room with treats such as Twizzlers, Tates Cookies, mints, etc. The public sitting area is beautiful and the restaurant Ago is a great meeting spot. Overall I think it is a great find and a nice change from the more traditional luxury hotels in NYC.",Dec-08,1028569,4,23222227,5,dixon73
“Highly recommended”,"I stayed in this Tribeca hotel for five nights and will return. My room was lovely with hardwood floors, high ceiling and a large opening window. The amenities were great; the bed comfortable and firm without being rock hard. The staff were excellent; the doormen prompt and friendly, the desk staff attentive and helpful. It has the most beautiful gym I have ever used in my life and the equipment is excellent. Although the website doesn't say (nor do the staff when you call): there is a Japanese style pool as well (about 85F), so be sure to bring a bathing suit. It is quiet with surprisingly little street noise (much less than at the Ganzevoort or the Library Hotels), and the interior door helps keep noise out from the hallways (although they are very quiet in any event). The location is great. It took only a few minutes to walk to Soho, and it is just a couple of blocks off the Hudson River. The riverfront park directly west of the hotel is being restored and is completely torn up right now; however, if you go just a block or two south it is a lovely walk for miles. I felt very safe walking Greenwich Street at night and it was nice to know that the staff would have noticed if I hadn't made it back in the evening. There is a courtyard and lounge for guests only and they are a very nice respite from the city streets without having to hole up in your hotel room. One thing I found annoying were the numerous business meetings the hotel conducted in the lounge. Whenever a meeting was ongoing (every evening), it felt more like I was sitting in a conference room than relaxing in a guest-only lounge. The restaurant was nothing to write home about. The service and ambience were great, but the menu was uninspired and the execution unimpressive. My meal tasted exclusively of salt. Thalassa (a Greek restaurant just a few blocks away) is a much better choice.",Nov-08,1028569,27,22042824,5,Cindy12388
“Very nice”,"I recently stayed for 2 nights and was very happy with all aspects of the hotel. The room was eclectic and interesting, like all of the decor in the hotel, and had great sheets, towels, products (Red Flower), etc. I like the gratis mini-bar and snacks (not including alcohol) and free wi-fi. Good pool. Best of all was the service which was so pleasant and helpful. I'd stay there again in a second.",Nov-08,1028569,8,21979051,4,Ilikegoodtravel
“Dissapointing”,"We stayed at the Greenwich hotel for two nights in October and were overall very dissapointed. The room was big and the bed very confortable, but it was very cold and impersonal. The desk staff were nice, but we felt like we were the only ones staying at the hotel. There were also VERY annoying sounds all night long. There was something depressing about the place. We much preferred the Mercer...",Oct-08,1028569,3,21772463,2,StinoParis
“Truly badly conceived and executed.”,"I am still surprised that I spent 766.00 per night in such an uninspiring hotel and such a small room which was not starkly furnished, was just bleak.
Lighting is such a problem they put it as a specific multiple choice on the comment card.
The pool was closed for ""cleaning' during my stay.
The staff is very good, but that can't make up for the really poorly 
executed project which I found artless and almost depressing.

THe room was beautifully appointed with a comfortable bed, high count sheets and a tiny balcony that looked over a courtyard. The bathroom was stunning and luxurious. The mini bar was gratis except for the liquor. They have a beautiful pool and large fitness area. Both are surrounded by the construction (the hotel just opened) but accessible to guests. The only disapppointment was the restaurant Ago which was in a lovely lofy space, but the food was barely adequate.
